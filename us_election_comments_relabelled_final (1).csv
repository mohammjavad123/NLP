Seven battleground states, any of which could potentially swing to either the Democrats or Republicans, hold the keys to the presidency in the 2024 election as voters make their choice between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.

Both Harris and Trump have made repeated visits to these competitive states, where CBS News polling shows the candidates were virtually tied in the lead-up to Election Day.

lvetw6d,"I have seen a lot of fact checks on Harris and Biden recently that claim a statement they are making is ""False"" simply because Trump never explicitly *said* that he would do the thing that Biden or Harris is claiming would happen.

In these instances, it feels like you are really giving Trump's word or even lack of word a lot of weight, when he's proven in many instances that he is a liar and will often do the opposite of what he says he will do.

In that case it feels really corny to spend any breath saying that a claim made about Trump's plan, on abortion for example, is ""false"" because he never *said* he would go for a national abortion ban. It takes us for absolute idiots to believe that isn't in the cards should he win.

Wouldn't it make sense to distinguish between a **claim** and a statement of fact? A claim is essentially an assertion that something is true, and doesn't necessarily mean it's a lie (as long as the speaker believes it).",2024-11-04 16:06:37,13,politics,True,1
lvdsku8,"I was just scrolling through Politifact yesterday, and I did have a question. Has there been a significant increase in misinformation this year over previous election years? Just curious if there is any empirical data to quantify it, or even just anecdotal. It seems like a majority of statements rated are ""Mostly False"" or lower (especially for Trump, who appeared to have only had a single statement rated ""Mostly True"" or higher in the last year), but I'm curious if that's because the amount of true statements is far lower this year, versus an editorial choice to prefer to correct false statements.

Thank you for your work. I still can't believe my mom's friend 8 years ago who rejected your site as ""biased"" and chose to believe some terrible misinformation from some pundit on Fox News instead.

lvdowl3,"Ellen: I think it really depends on what kind of an event it is that we’re fact-checking. 

Our reporters listen to *a lot* of speeches and interviews by the candidates, and they get very familiar with their stump speeches. When it comes to a major rally, we’ve usually heard and fact-checked whatever a candidate is repeating, so we’re listening for anything new or newsworthy.

For live fact-checking a debate, it’s a similar process, but we spend a lot of time before hand prepping things we suspect the candidates might say. (Not to brag, but our team doc to prep for the Trump-Harris debate was 100+ pages long.) One group on our team works on immediately sharing what we have prepped on social media or [our live blog,](https://www.politifact.com/article/2024/sep/10/presidential-debate-live-fact-check-harris-trump/) while another group starts working on new claims that come up so we can get a [fact-check](https://www.politifact.com/article/2024/sep/11/2024-presidential-debate-fact-check-harris-trump/) out quickly. 

And then there’s big breaking news events, like the Baltimore bridge collapse or the Trump assassination attempt in July or Hurricane Helene or Election Day, where we can’t really prepare. Breaking news can create an information gap as everyone is scrambling to get answers, and social media loves to fill that gap with misinformation. 

In these cases, we’re often in triage mode, trying to address the most serious, harmful or prevalent misinformation spreading online. That includes things like false claims about [FEMA aid](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/06/tweets/fema-gives-750-to-help-hurricane-victims-with-supp/) might dissuade survivors from getting help or disinformation that [discourages people from voting](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/nov/03/tweets/this-video-about-ballot-fraud-is-not-from-the-fbi/). It can be difficult since there might not be a ton of information available at the moment; For example, we waited to publish fact-checks about the shooter who attempted to assassinate Trump until his identity was confirmed by authorities. But during breaking news, we’re more concerned about getting it right than getting it first. ",2024-11-04 16:06:37,5,politics,True,0

2024 is nothing like that.  There was something different in the air in 16, and I genuinely feel that the air from then is stale and old now.  24 feels just a bit more sane, a bit more hopeful.

lvdvb22,"I was deeply conservative throughout my teens until I (of course) went to college and unraveled everything I had been thinking up to that time.  A moment I remember was telling my new college friends that I heard a story on Fox News.  They made fun of me so hard for that, and that was the first time I ever realized that news sources could be biased.  This was in 2010, so while not the Fox News it is now, it was still bad.

Since then I've mainly lived in NYC and have become pretty fucking liberal at this point.  Now, there's so many things I think back to and cringe about from growing up.  Things that were so normalized, and it helps me see why so many still support Trump.

  
1. Insane fear about people who don't look or act like you.  Blaming them instead of corporations or politicians.

2. Coded racism.  People used to say things like ""Oh, you get people from \*insert predominantly black area\* coming to those events.""  Which, even as a kid, you understood what they meant.

3. Calling poor people ""lazy"" even though we were almost homeless at one point.  Looking down on people that received government services.  Something we never did for some reason.

4. Complete fear of cities or going to non-white towns/cities.

5. Weirdly, a fear of public schools even within our white town.  My parents paid way too much to send us to private schools, but I then had to transfer to public when my dad lost his job.  So many kids at my private school joked that I was going to get stabbed or robbed.

  
This was all in the North East as well!  Not like we were the deep south.  However, my hometown is definitely a Trump town now, so it could very well be in the middle of Alabama at this point haha.

  
Even now, my 10 year old nephew came to visit our NYC apartment and asked ""There's a lot of drug dealers here, aren't there?"".  He's fucking 10.

Just this fear and paranoia that gets ramped up to brainwashing levels.  I know it's been here for our entire history, but I really hope that we're noticing all this conflict because we're finally shining a light on it, and people are realizing how fucked a worldview it is.",2024-11-04 12:49:59,25,politics,True,1

People came from NY, NJ, CT, and other states to volunteer, and the energy was great. We met lots of Harris supporters, some registered democrats who said they simply cannot vote for Trump or anyone in the current republican party. We also met a few Trump supporters, some of them registered democrats who flipped. Some were beyond help and parroted the same shit about abortions in the 40th week and elections being stolen. But still, overall a very good day. 

The field offices in PA have tons of extra yard signs they're giving away. Some will even drop them by your house if you call in and ask. So if anyone wants a sign and doesn't have it, call or drive down to your local Harris field office.

Lastly, there are still opportunities to volunteer in the next 48 hours. Canvassing and phone/text banking. If you can spare a few hours, volunteering is easy and fun, and makes a real impact!

>Before polling began, we looked at what we thought would be the likely turnout in 2024. Every poll we conducted --- including this one --- was weighted exactly the same. We weighted party affiliation, gender, age, race, area, and education. It seems clear now that we are under sampling women, African Americans, and the City of Detroit based on absentee ballot returns and early voting. However, to assure we are comparing ‘apples to apples,’ we kept the same weights we have used all along. Because of our strong belief in transparency, we always include our crosstabs, so it is easy to substantiate our use of the same weights on every poll.

lv72yh3,"For those who were curious, Texas Early vote update - 8.9 million early vote total per UF Election lab.

I've seen conflicting data on this, with some saying 2020 was 9.7 million early votes, others are saying less, but even if that's true, that was during a pandemic environment with a full week's extra time of early voting. Hitting about 9 million in a ""normal"" election environment is very, very promising. Especially with stronger turnout in urban areas like Houston this cycle.

I cannot promise anything. Lord knows this state disappoints us so many times, but the chance of Allred beating Cruz is now very real. The catch is that we need to turn out the final group of lower propensity Dem leaning voters in the next 2 days. Reach out to them today and tomorrow and help them come up with a voting plan on Tuesday. Polls will be open 7AM-7PM on Tuesday the 5th, but are closed today and tomorrow. Polls will be open in many more locations, despite all of the state's history of shenanigans. Registered voters increased to somewhere past 18 million voters this cycle, over 1 million more since 2022 alone. Party affiliation isn't required here, so don't read into those who attempt to estimate it too much, and there are signs of weaknesses for Trump in the rural areas this cycle.

Can Texas flip? I don't know, but if it can, the turnout we generate in the next 2 days will be the determining factor. And we really, really need more Dem senators, so this election has national implications.

Help us finally send Cruz packin', and maybe we'll get some extra surprises to go along with it. If the demographic trends in the Selzer poll hold some national trends (where women living under abortion restrictions are voting against them in record numbers), that trend could easily hold nationally and impact the southern states as well (where the restrictions are just as bad, if not worse than Iowa).

I don't know enough to say anything with certainty, but I can tell you it's a total bipartisan effort. Equal amount of republicans and democrats in an election role for each polling location. There's a paper trail for EVERYTHING, and they spend a lot of time and effort crafting accurate poll books and making sure people aren't registered in multiple places. 

Bottom line, any claim of election interference would have either a paper trail to at least POINT towards election interference, or have a statistical anomaly in other parts of data..

The election is far from 'fair and secure' and Republicans are responsible. 
  
Likewise, I am 100% confident of a 0% chance of any *legitimate* Trump victory for the following reasons:    
     
- Trump already lost to Biden/Harris in 2020    
- Covid disproportionately killed Trump voters   
- Trump voters skew older and many have died since 2020    
- Millions of younger people are now eligible to vote - and they skew heavily toward Harris/Walz.
- Harris/Walz is a wildly more popular ticket than Biden/Harris was. Most 'double-haters' are now enthusiastic Harris/Walz supporters.        
- Trump's insurrection, being found liable for rape, and felony convictions have driven some Republicans to vote against him. They have not attracted new voters *to* Trump
- Dozens of former Trump Admin officials have denounced Trump - which they *hadn't* done in 2020  
- Many Republicans and independents who voted for Trump in 2020 are now voting for Harris     
- RFK Jr. and Jill Stein are stealing votes from Trump anywhere they are on the ballot - more than they are taking votes from Harris.   
- Almost nobody who voted for Biden in 2020 is now voting for Trump, who has not expanded his base. 
- The Madison Square Garden debacle has even further incited negative voter sentiment and backlash against the Trump ticket.  
  
A *legitimate* Trump win is a near mathematical impossibility.   
  
Note the heavy-lifting being done by the word *legitimate*.  
  
Trump and the GOP have been actively engaged in widespread, nationwide conspiracy to commit election fraud since 2020, virtually unopposed by Biden's Justice Department under Republican sympathizer Merrick Garland. 
  
The fraud is so pervasive as to potentially overcome even a substantial lead for Harris on election day. 
  
Republicans have already announced and published their plans to obstruct local elections, confuse the process, steal ballots, burn ballot drop boxes, introduce errors, cause interminable delays, once again send fake electors with fraudulent results, and lean on corrupt judges to make unlawful rulings in their favor. 
  
In fact, the widespread, open, numerous and flagrant acts of election interference, disruption, obstruction, and fraud being committed by Republican voters and officials is providing a massive amount of evidence Democrats can use to contest any claimed Trump victory. 
  
At this point, there is ample reason to absolutely reject any Republican claims of a Trump win next week. Republicans have provided a mountain of justification for believing any such outcome is purely the result of fraud.  
  
The Harris campaign, Biden Administration, and Biden's Justice Department (though fat chance on Merrick Garland doing jack-shit) need to strenuously oppose any claims of a Trump win, raising challenges based on VERY apparent election interference/fraud/obstruction by Republican operatives nationwide. And unlike the 63 cases Trump lost in courts across the country due to a complete lack of evidence, there is TONS of evidence of Republican-led fraud in THIS cycle.",2024-11-02 16:16:41,3,politics,True,1

Thanks for the tip, I'll watch it after the election. 

>Even the democratic party of the time ignored county votes to nominate Hillary in states that had chosen Bernie Sanders unequivocally.

I don't know what incident you are referencing even though I wouldn't have called the 2016 Democratic primary fair regardless, but it really is an apples and oranges comparison between how a private organization like the DNC or RNC runs and operates a primary and how a general election works. It's not evidence of anything when it comes to an actual general election, and the post title is still completely accurate.

> Harris was also “chosen”, not “voted for”. 

Harris was nominated the same way that every other DNC candidate was nominated, by a bunch of delegates getting together and voting for her at a designated time and place so that the nominee's name will be on the ballot for all fifty states. No Democrat challenged her, nobody was interested in challenging her, and if hypothetically they did challenge her they would have lost that challenge and Harris would still be the nominee right now, whether through delegate count or even if they had time or the rules in place for a second primary (which the DNC didn't).

Ultimately this is election is the easiest decision in the history of decisions. Do you want a senile rapist narcissistic Hitler-loving felon in the While House or Kamala Harris? Who do you think Michael Moore is going to vote for? 

And for the record I still have my Bernie Sanders shirt I bought in 2016, and supported him in the last two elections. But when I came down to it I still voted for Hillary in the general election just as I already voted for Harris this election. The only person at fault for the unusual circumstances of Harris nomination is Joe Biden, but if he didn't do what he did then Biden would be a nominee that 2/3rds of Democrats didn't want as the nominee despite primary results. He saw the bad options laid out before him and took the least worst one. If Americans are capable of making a much easier choice then this election won't even be close.

Many states have laws saying their electors have to vote for who they were sent to vote for or who won the state, or face consequences.  After.  And they’re not very scary.  A couple states allow for replacing an elector who looks like they will be wonky.

That was Trump’s plan in 2020: they sent “alternate slates” (read: fraudulent and uncertified) of electors who claimed they represented the states but voted the opposite way.  And we really don’t have a legal workaround for that.  Because yes. It is decided by the electoral college, not the popular vote.  A recent supreme court ruling may effect parts of this, but not much


Notes:

-There were 10 total defectors in 2016, out of 538 electors.  Defectors vote for the “wrong” people on day of, and the votes usually stand.  So 2 votes from my state went to Collin Powell instead of Clinton, for whatever reason the electors had.

-there are no federal standards for how electors are chosen or how they can vote.  By convention, they vote for the person who won their state or district’s election.  But each state legislature chooses their electors and there is no requirement they choose taking into account the election.  Other than the fact their constituents may well be very unhappy.

For a system stuck together with duck tape and glue, it works remarkably well.  However, it was not intelligently designed because it wasn’t designed.  The constitution allocates the electoral votes, how the state gives them out is technically up to the state.  So each state has its own wonky little system.",2024-11-02 16:16:41,2,politics,True,0

luwn9dr,"**Presenting: Grapelander's guide to not dooming about random cherrypicked high turnout rural counties in Georgia!**

There are three illusions at play in Georgia rural county turnout numbers: 

The first, many of these counties are suffering from population decay. If there's a difference in the rate at which people in general are leaving the county, and the rate at which reliable voters are, you can get counties that look like this:

2020: 10,000 registered voters, 5,000 voted, 50% turnout

2024: 8,000 registered voters, 4,500 voted. 56% turnout. 

But this can get reported as *112% of 2020's turnout already! Oh no, rurals exploding! Democrats in shambles!* by people who want you to believe that Georgia is screwed. Even though the actual raw vote numbers show fewer people voting. 

The second, on the opposite end of the spectrum, are republican leaning counties that have had huge population growth. On the surface, this seems bad. And it can be reported badly, [like this](https://x.com/cookoutEnjoyer/status/1852418864711381403). ""*Oh no, this rural Trump-dominated county has already outvoted 2020! Disaster*."" Forsyth County and a lot of the Atlanta exurbs are super prone to this. 

However....this is almost entirely down to population growth. These areas are exploding. That county has 3000 more registered voters than they did last time. And the incoming voters aren't necessarily following the trends of the county's historical voting record. [Take a look at the 2016-2020 swing map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election_in_Georgia#/media/File:Georgia_County_Swing_2020.svg) before jumping to conclusions on republican counties with growth. It may not be as bad as feared, and in many cases may in fact end up being a net margin gain for democrats. 

Notice that lots of Georgia early vote dooming and republican victory laps are reliant on cherry-picked outlier counties with data selectively reported in one of these two ways, depending on which one fits the narrative. 

Finally, the rural counties are mostly seeing dramatically higher numbers of 2020 election day voters shifting to early voting than the ruban ones are. This [extends to the racial breakdown as well](https://x.com/stphnfwlr/status/1852000284622406107). Democrats are preserving more of their likely election day vote. And some of the dem strongholds driven by the black vote that seem lagging (Clayton, Richmond, Chatham) all had *very* high election day turnout in 2020. All 3 are on pace to meet or exceed 2020 turnout if they can pull a similar election day rate. Some of the Atlanta metro counties are on pace to crush it, and/or project to see further margin gains by democrats.

luvxl9r,"Cook Political Report shifts six House races to Dems, two to GOP

https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4965678-cook-political-report-final-house-races-shifted-2024/

Per Cook Political…

>The race for control of the U.S. House remains as close as it’s ever been. 
>
>The battleground is confined to a few dozen seats, with neither party having a clear advantage in a majority of seats. And with several competitive races in West Coast states that take longer to count their ballots, it’s highly possible we won’t know which party has control on election night.
>
> At the moment, Republicans hold 221 seats to Democrats’ 214. 
> 
> In our final House race ratings, Democrats are favored in 205 seats, while Republicans are favored in 208, leaving 22 seats in the Toss Up column. If the Toss Ups split down the middle, Republicans would maintain their majority by an even narrower 219 to 216 seat margin.
> 
> Though Republicans are favored in a few more seats, they also have a lower ceiling, since they’re defending more competitive territory. If Republicans sweep the Toss Ups, they’d pick up nine seats, while if Democrats sweep the Toss Ups they would pick up 13 seats.

The House is up for grabs.

luwopw2,"Just listened to a podcast with Joe Truppi and Tom Bonier, and one of them made a good ancillary point not related to polling or statistics.

We often describe Trump as ""Teflon Don"" and say that he never suffers any consequences for his actions; even for his crimes. However, one of the hosts pointed out that he and Lara Trump are sucking so much money out of the RNC to pay for his legal bills, that they don't have the money to do real ground game and GOTV efforts. This is going to directly hurt his chances of winning the election...and thus hurt his chances of staying out of prison.

It has the added benefit of sucking away money from down ballot races, and thus reducing the number (and perhaps the willingness) of elected Republicans able to try to pull some sort of shenanigans to get him off.

luws59x,"Nate Cohn says:

“It’s hard to overstate how traumatic the 2016 and 2020 elections were for many pollsters. For some, another underestimate of Mr. Trump could be a major threat to their business and their livelihood. For the rest, their status and reputations are on the line. If they underestimate Mr. Trump a third straight time, how can their polls be trusted again? It is much safer, whether in terms of literal self-interest or purely psychologically, to find a close race than to gamble on a clear Harris victory.

At the same time, the 2016 and 2020 polling misfires shattered many pollsters’ confidence in their own methods and data. When their results come in very blue, they don’t believe it. And frankly, I share that same feeling: If our final Pennsylvania poll comes in at Harris +7, why would I believe it? As a result, pollsters are more willing to take steps to produce more Republican-leaning results.”

luux9pa,"Anyone else curious about who the Unaffiliated voters are in NC? I thought I'd post some interesting information I found courtesy of UNC about their characteristics. 

Younger voters are the most likely to register as unaffiliated. Forty-six percent of voters ages 18-34 are registered unaffiliated compared to 39% of voters ages 35-54, 29% of voters ages 55-74, and 25% of voters 75 and older. As a result, younger adults, especially those ages 18-34, comprise a larger share of unaffiliated voters than the overall electorate.

Compared to the state population overall, unaffiliated voters are more likely to identify as white (66% vs. 64%). Asian (2.3%) and Hispanic (5%) voters also are more likely amongst unaffiliated voters, in comparison to the electorate as a whole, while black voters (11%) are less common. Voters who did not report a race or ethnic identification were the most likely to register as unaffiliated (53%), followed by Asian (53%), other race (47%), Hispanic (46%), multiracial (44%), White (37%), and American Indian (36%) voters. Black voters were the least likely to register as unaffiliated (22%).

Excluding North Carolina-born voters, Northeastern-born voters are the most likely to be registered as unaffiliated and account for over 14% of all unaffiliated voters. Fifty percent of voters born in both Rhode Island and Massachusetts and 49% of New Hampshire-born voters are registered unaffiliated, followed by Vermont (47%). Aside from the Northeast, just under 14% of unaffiliated voters hail from a southern state besides North Carolina, followed by 8% from the Midwest, and 4% from the West. Over a fifth of all unaffiliated voters don’t report their place of birth (22%).

Just over 875,000 unaffiliated voters — 33% of the state’s unaffiliated voter population—were born in North Carolina. New York (149K), another country (114K), Virginia (89K), New Jersey (61K), and Florida (61K) were the next most common birthplaces outside of North Carolina.

The top 10 counties for unaffiliated voters include:
Western counties of Transylvania (45%), Watauga (45%), Henderson (44%), and Buncombe (42%) Jackson (42%), and Madison (41%);
Coastal counties of Camden (45%), Currituck (43%), and Dare (42%); and Wake County (42%) in the Triangle.

luuo2hp,"As a 2000 Nader voter, I have _opinions_ on this subject of third-party voting.

Let's talk president first. Let's say you just want to get your candidate/party to 5% of the vote to qualify for PECF minor-party status for funding for the next election. Cool! That's happened 14 times in US history, most recently in 1996 with Perot. **Every single one bombed** out the next election and the majority of them dissolved afterward. No third party has every leveraged the PECF into future success, because they didn't win any power and thus couldn't do anything, and thus had nothing to run on the next election.

Maybe you're aiming higher, you think you can outright win the EC as a third party (because SteinWare are actually claiming that). Third parties took 2nd place in both 1872 and 1912! It's not that big a lift, right? Those were **4-candidate splits** and the winner still had an outright majority.

I've just now typed and deleted about two paragraphs of how the FPP and EC mathematically lead to two parties and that any deviation from that is basically punished, but I realize that's appealing to the wrong level. Let's try this:

If someone thinks that the **President** is the person that has the power to effect all the progressive change that they desire, they are _morally inconsistent_ in the following way. They do not believe in fixed hierarchies. They do not believe in kings as the best method of governance. They (hopefully) recognize that unions, communities, and collectives are the best model for action, not top-down edicts. They cannot consistently reconcile that with a unitary executive. This is not their fault! There's a lot of evolutionary pressure for humans to respond to Authority in times of stress.

So why would a progressive _candidate_ be honestly targeting the executive position without a union, community, or collective backing? Why are they not building a foundation? Why is it that out of the 520,000 elected positions in the US, the Green party (ditto Libertarian) holds **180** of them? That is not a serious movement.

lup2qtg,"A local attorney posted this on LinkedIn yesterday. 

You should buy a gun. Yeah, I know. You dislike firearms and wish we lived in a world without them. But ignoring reality never solves problems. The reality is that Trump may win or steal the election, and he’s made no secret about how he will govern.
Want more reality? On July 2, 2024, Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, told reporters,
“We are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless - if the left allows it to be.” A few days later, North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson ominously told supporters, “Some people need killing.” apparently referring to “socialists.”
Want more reality? In May, Trump distributed a video promising to create a “unified Reich” if elected.
Need more reality? In April, Sen. Tom Cotton publicly encouraged Americans to throw protestors off bridges.
Also in April, MAGA hero and failed candidate Kari Lake encouraged supporters to “Strap on a Glock” to prepare for the upcoming election.
These people claim to belong to the party the “Party of Freedom,” but their words and actions prove they are fascists. They loath democracy and threaten violence to get their way. Americans killed fascists overseas in World War II. We must now face the reality that American fascists may force us to kill them on our own soil.
Which brings us to why you should buy a gun. There are three reasons.
The first is to send a message. MAGA knows most Americans don’t want a fascist theocracy, so MAGA leaders routinely threaten violence to intimidate the rest of us. I’ve taught karate for a long time. Failure to stand up to bullies only emboldens them. The MAGA cult must know the rest of us are ready to fight, if necessary, to protect ourselves and our country. So, buy a gun. Learn to use it. Store it safely. Don’t threaten anyone with it.
That’s all you need do. Your mere purchase and possession of it will help restrain MAGA and fascism.
The second reason you should buy a gun is to prepare to defend yourself, your loved ones, and the weak if Trump and the fascists gain power and come for you because you speak out. You should buy a gun for the same reason you should buy a socket wrench set. You may need it someday. I hope it doesn’t come to that, but Benjamin Disraeli was right when he wrote, “I am prepared for the worst, but hope for the best.”
Let me offer a hypothetical. It’s 2027. Federal law makes it a capital offense to have an abortion. The police received a tip that your daughter had an abortion. They are approaching your front door. What will you do?
Will you let them take your daughter and execute her? You can dodge my hypothetical by telling yourself that could never happen in America. It’s a horrible choice to have to contemplate, but the horror of it does not make the hypothetical unrealistic.
The typical liberal response to my second argument is, “You can’t fight the entire United States government.” It’s a straw man argument. I do not suggest that you can or should take up arms against our government. But you can prepare for the death of democracy, if it happens, and the emergence of a theocratic police state. You can give yourself options if the worst-case scenario presents itself at your doorstep. You won’t stop evil by yourself, but wars are not won by the actions of one person. They are won by the cumulative sacrifices of many.
The third reason you should buy a gun is to protect yourself from the MAGA cult. They preach hate toward gays, minonities, immigrants, disabled people, and anyone who disagrees with them. They preach hate toward government itself. They are armed, ignorant, and filled with hate, and that makes them a danger to every person that is not a white, Christian male.
The law defines negligence as a failure to do an act which a reasonably careful person would do, or the doing of an act which a reasonably careful person would not do, under the same or similar circumstances to protect oneself or others. Don’t be negligent.
When I wrote the first draft of this piece a few months ago, I shared it with a friend I trust and respect.
She told me it was defeatist. Since then, the Supreme Court abolished the principle that the President is not above the law, and Trump is quoting Hitler more frequently. Career military leaders, mostly Republicans, are telling us Trump will rule like a dictator.
I pray I am wrong. I hope that years from now people read this and laugh at me. I could handle that. What would be worse, though, would be to remain silent and see these fascists take America without firing a shot. You should buy a gun.",2024-10-31 13:07:07,1,politics,True,1

lt5lotc,"**US election dispatch from Molly Blackall:**

LANSING, MICHIGAN –  “I remember that I was leading services, and someone came up to me and said Rabbi, something terrible has happened. That’s how I learnt there was something horrible amiss,” says Matthew Kaufman, Rabbi of Kehillat Israel.

“Of course, things only got worse from there. The community has been torn apart in many ways by 7 October and the subsequent war. It struck very personally, even though we’re here in Lansing, Michigan, very far away from what happened. Thousands of miles away, there is still a connection.”

There are few American communities untouched by the conflict continuing to escalate in the Middle East, and Michigan’s capital city is no exception.

A Michigan State University student with friends at the local mosque died alongside 17 of his relatives in an Israeli air strike on Gaza.

The 79-year-old relative of one of Lansing’s Jewish congregation was taken hostage by Hamas on 7 October and died in captivity. Many in Lansing have watched relatives and friends suffer in the region.

The conflict has proved to be one of the most divisive issues of the upcoming presidential election, and triggered a surge in both Islamophobic and anti-Semitic hate crimes.

But faith leaders in Lansing have worked to forge a different path.

ltvik40,"Whew ok -- good morning/afternoon by the way and happy Saturday -- I see you question dismissing a newspaper simply based on it being owned by a theocratic ruler who imprisons people for tweets. On that, you and I simply disagree. I WILL outright dismiss it *as a reliable source*. Sure, a broken clock is correct twice a day and many of their articles hold truth, but an unbiased source, from the ruler of Qatar, when the balance of the middle east rests partly on this election? Hell no. 

The OP didn't ask 'what are some sources that aren't totally trustworthy but that I'll be able to spend time countering with other sources until I uncover the buried truth?' I think they want to do as little reading as possible. 

I just don't see the value in the exercise you propose, and it is definitely not what OP was asking for. OP is not trying to bolster their own argument and counter others. They simply want some fair info, quickly, easily. 

I also did not say to ignore al jazeera. We all encounter AJ articles all the time. But is it what OP was looking for - an unbiased source? No. 

I just remembered -- Qatar also financially backs Hamas, who is obviously a party to one of two major ongoing international wars, and are sort of, like, bad dudes. Like really bad dudes. Anyway...def not biased.

ltvp2jk,"I didn't say they're biased because they're pro Hamas. I said they're biased because they financially back a warring party in an escalating conflict. I don't think AJ and the Qatari government are separable like NPR and USA. 

I believe that, despite the subsidies from government grants dedicated to the arts, NPR is not 'owned' by the US government and does not take direction from it, like AJ does. I do not believe NPR is a voice of the current American administration which is how it would be if it was controlled by the federal government. I do not think NPR'S relationship to the American government is the equivalent of AJ's to the Qatari, despite funding from the national broadcasting act.

I don't know how to do the quote thing, but you said that I don't extend the same criticism of bias to the pro-israel papers like NYT and WaPo. I'll just take this opportunity to say that I think NYT, CNN and WaPo are biased and I don't recommend them as an individual, one-stop shop for unbiased election info for someone who wants quick answers. Get that cleared up there. However, they are still not equivalent. I do not know that Jeff bezos arms the IDF. They are biased for other reasons I guess. 

But you included NPR and called them pro-zionist. If you mean they are pro Israel-existing-as-a-country, I can not argue that, as only a monster would argue for the eradication of an entire country. But if you mean supportive of netanyahu's administration's actions, you clearly haven't been listening to NPR.

Hi! I love Germany!!!! <3 Well it's basically political theater here haha. The election will only be called if it's a big electoral college difference OR if one candidate concedes the election. Otherwise it can take several days to verify an election due to some states counting ballots longer or having electronic counting vs hand counting.

I hear in 2000 Fox News MAY have been responsible for kind of peer pressuring people to call an election. (I may be wrong but I remember hearing Fox News called it before the official numbers were released). You need to look more into that don't take my word for it.

It is advertised as ""predicting"" every election because it was synthesised from the outcomes of all of the ones that occurred prior to the model, but has only actually succeeded in 9 out of the 10 it was actually used to predict since the fact. That's not a bad record by any means, but it's not perfect. It's not like the laws of physics, which are predictive because they mechanically cause the outcomes of events; systems like this, which try to predict something as unstable and random as an election, will only ever be right until they aren't.

The model is also demonstrably incoherent when applied in some contexts, so for example the existence of a strong third party candidate is taken to provide an advantage to the challenger party regardless of what platform the third party stands on. Imagine if Trump lost the primary this year, and then ran as a third  party candidate with a ""MAGA party"", splitting the conservative vote. According to the keys, this would help the Republicans to win, but this obviously could not be further from the truth when examined practically.

Gold demand has exceeded $100bn (£77bn) for the first time as [investors race to secure the safe-haven asset](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/investing/news/wealthy-stockpile-gold-silver-coins-labour-tax-raid/) before the [US election](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us-election/).

The value of global gold purchases between July and September surged by 35pc year-on-year, according to a report from the World Gold Council.

Traders responded after the price of gold hit successive monthly highs between July and September, with the total weight purchased over the quarter rising 5pc year-on-year to hit 1,313 tonnes.

The surge in activity has come amid a growing sense of uncertainty surrounding the US election on Nov 5, as well as high geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.

Strong demand pushed average London Bullion Market Association gold prices across the quarter up 28pc year-on-year, over which period they hit a record high of $2,474/oz.

Gold prices have hit a record high on 30 different occasions since January, climbing again on Wednesday to reach $2,779/oz.

Louise Street, senior markets analyst at the World Gold Council, said there was a “fear-of-missing-out factor” amongst investors.

Ms Street said: “Investors have shown an appetite to buy into the price momentum, are encouraged by the prospect of future interest rate decreases and are also considering gold’s role as a safe haven in the face of US political uncertainty and escalating conflicts in the Middle East.”

Heightened levels of gold demand from Western traders have offset a recent dip in sales in Asia, industry experts added.

The geographical split has [emerged as markets bet on Donald Trump succeeding](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/10/21/why-prospect-trump-election-victory-triggered-scramble-gold/) in the upcoming US election, with the Republican candidate expected to pursue an inflationary economic agenda.

One of Trump’s key promises is to implement [widespread trade tariffs](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/10/29/why-trump-could-crush-the-british-economy/) of up to 20pc on the value of goods coming into the US from other countries and up to 60pc on imports from China.

Economists have warned this would drive up the cost of goods, with Morgan Stanley estimating that tariffs could add nearly a whole percentage point to the US rate of inflation.

Meanwhile, while the price of gold keeps climbing, [oil prices have fallen sharply](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/10/28/ftse-100-markets-latest-news-uk-budget-reeves-landlords/) in recent days after Israeli air strikes avoided Iranian oil and gas facilities.

You mentioned:

>>*In four years, realistically. Unless blue figures their stuff out you all have those four years and a midterm to do it.*

JD will be declared president due to the rapid cognitive and mental decline of Trump.

>*If he is reelected, former President Donald Trump, now 78 years old, would be the oldest president ever elected. After a number of appearances where his remarks were rambling or incoherent, and one event in which he swayed silently to music on stage for close to 40 minutes, questions are being raised about possible cognitive decline.*

There are true signs.

>*There are people who count syllables, and they count the speech rate, and they count the number of things like how much he curses and things like that, and have noted changes. They have noted changes in his syntax, the grammatical complexity of his language.*

His family has a history of dementia.

It's hereditary.

>*So, again, not making a formal diagnosis of dementia - you need to actually assess him formally and face-to-face in order to do that. You can't diagnose anyone in absentia. But what we're seeing is real, and it's - part of the challenge is, so, look, again, he's 78 years old. If this was your grandfather, you probably wouldn't think twice about it. Again, we all decline with age. What I'm seeing is more challenges with the thought processes, that, again, I'm not saying that he has dementia, but they are suggestive of, if you sort of took this all in totality, right?*

Trump has all of it.

>*So, problems with memory loss, communication difficulties, changes in mood, poor judgment, personality changes, those in total are what really the symptoms of dementia.* 

I will **repeat what I said before.**

I would not trust this man with my children.

Why would I trust him with my country or with **any interaction he needs to have on the world stage?**

Yikes!

Talk to friends and family and sell them on Harris.

She has an economic plan approved by hundreds of economists.

It’s comprehensive. And she doesn’t just say “tariffs, tariffs, tariffs “ because unlike Trump, she understands that would make imports more expensive for Americans and lead to higher inflation.

Plus she doesn’t threaten to end the first amendment like Trump has when he threatened to imprison journalists, critics and non-Christians.

Plus she doesn’t threaten to end the Second amendment like when he said in Feb 2018 “take the guns first, due process later.”

Plus she doesn’t threaten to terminate the entire Constitution like Trump did in December 2022.  you know, the whole “we the people “ document folks have on their bumper sticker.

Jon Stewart did a really good segment on how the candidates are being warped by the media.

We can do this.

We've gone from disagreeing on issues to just being disagreeable with people. We need to stop that shit and getting rid of Trump is the first step to that cuz that's what he thrives on.

Donald Trump's stump speech offers no plans to do anything when he gets into office he just goes on the attack immediately he boasts about himself, and guys like Elon Musk when he brings them to the stage.

What risk?

Illegal alien A shows up in Michigan, and steals the identity of US citizen B, who lives in New Jersey, in order to work.

Illegal alien A uses the stolen identity to get a drivers license in Michigan and is automatically registered to vote.

Michigan does not check to see if the identity is real.  The IRS identifies the Michigan identity as false, but tells no one.  The NJ US citizen has no idea his identity has been stolen.

An absentee ballot is requested for the Michigan illegal alien (not necessarily by the illegal alien), and he is put on the permanent ballot list, which means in future elections he will automatically be mailed a ballot without having to request one.

Since the Michigan illegal alien put down a residence address of the stash house he was staying at when he got his license, the ballots will be mailed there - along with the ballots for hundreds of other illegal aliens who have stayed there over time.

Come election time, the ballots will be collected (and voted) by a third party.

It has already been demonstrated that there is no significant signature verification, so those ballots are accepted.

Right... Trump was the one calling the other side ""deplorables"" and talking about how evil and fascist they were.  The ugly truth is that the left has gone into a purity spiral, and they are more than happy to throw the other side under the bus.  You claim that there are studies confirming what you say, but are they really?  It's a fact that we are more polarized, but the source is the leftist media, not Trump.

You remember that time Trump got shot?  That was because of all the stochastic terrorism from the left over the years.  I mean really, they have been directly comparing him to Hitler.  It's plain to see.

>he weakened NATO

I thought libertarians wanted less big government bodies?

>he started trade wars

Is it a bad thing to protect our markets from foreign sabotage?  If China can produce goods at a lower price because they're willing to exploit their people, is that a good thing?  Especially if it comes at the cost of American jobs?

>he politicized the justice department

When?

All I remember is the numerous raids on his and his allies' houses at 3am.  All 34 fake felonies from the kangaroo court, where the banks he supposedly defrauded testified in his defense, saying they were happy to do business with him?

Smells like projection to me.

>he relentlessly attacked the media and eroded press freedom

You're right that he's attacked the media.

They deserve it.

The media has been absolutely disgusting in their coverage of him, some networks were 90% or more negative coverage of Trump.  The media does not honestly report the truth, they create narratives that they're paid to create.  For example, the Hunter Biden laptop story which has now been proven to be real was denied as Russian propaganda.

As for erosion of press freedom, that was more Obama's thing.  If you can show me a single instance of Trump actually harming a reporter, I'd be shocked.

>his admin was probably the worst example of nepotism in government we’ve ever seen

Hunter Biden and Burisma.  Joe even bragged on camera about getting the prosecutor fired.

How was Trump nepotistic?

>he directly corruptly profited from his presidency (eg made foreign officials stay in his hotels) in an unprecedented manner

Acosta said. ""Doesn't any of this matter? Isn't this important that a candidate for president is saying Liz Cheney should be shot?"" Now, by only listening to Acosta (one of the most respected journalists on TV), you’d think that Trump was calling for Cheney to be facing a firing squad. So I tuned into FOX to see what they had to say. Turns out that Trump was referring to the fact that Cheney was a chicken hawk who favors sending American troops to fight in foreign conflicts, but doesn’t serve in the armed forces. He was saying that Cheney would not want to be facing enemy rifles trained on her. By the way, I also include Dick Cheney as a chicken hawk. What Acosta did by taking Trumps comments out of context was repeated by other respected media. I can no longer trust the media so I turn to alternative sources like podcasts. I’m not saying that podcasts are free from bias, but I’m glad to have them around. At least podcasters are up front about their bias.

I will commend Jonah Goldberg of CNN (who also expressed outrage at what he thought were Trump’s comments) for admitting his mistake and his bias:

Then if he were to win he'd look like the biggest clownshoe. Yet his supporters won't care.

However my first line is how you or anyone knows he's full of shit. It's super easy to see, you barely have to pay attention. Trump sees the world through ratings covered glasses.

If he's perceived terribly, he seems that he's the best there ever was and everyone is saying it.

When he KNOWS reversing Roe v Wade was on a majority a bad decision per the polling of a majority of Americans showing support for legal abortions with limitations, what those are has always been the contention since Roe came into being.

So instead, he sells it as ""everyone wanted this"" which is far from even remotely true, whatsoever. 

His brain is mush, but he is conscious enough to still see the world through those ratings lenses, he's conscious enough to know when he lost. He is conscious enough to see when he is perceptually being seen negatively or if he is even suggestively losing he will increase rhetoric of cheating and latch onto anything that is useful for selling that lie as believable.

Both sides of this argument called this right after he left office. The left said he'd run again to avoid oncoming legal culpability because it was coming no matter what. The documents case is an absolute slam dunk. The man is guilty af and Aileen Canon is either corrupt, incompetent, or both.

The right said at that time that the government would come after him to stop his next run. It's like a terrible soap opera my mom used to watch. It's utter garbage.

Which is more believable?? I choose to believe that the man who is now barred from running a charity because he embezzled funds from his own charity, money slated to be given to cancer kids, to buy a portrait of himself is exactly the person who has been on display right infront of our eyes.

A man who cheats people out of hard earned money in campaign donations by not properly informing those that donate it is a recurring payment.

A man who has cheated hundreds of contractors out of money owed off of a likely very scummy clause of work quality or something OR more likely than actual legal jargon in a contract it's likely he just knows they can't afford to take him to court and doesn't even need to bother.

A man who stole hundreds of classified documents that we don't even know the full scope of yet and may never.

Yeah, this ain't difficult. The charity thing alone is so utterly disqualifying. That's not even a personality thing. That's flatout unprofessional, illegal, scummy, EVIL shit. Oh yeah, ridiculously egotistical and vain.

Edit: and because the charity case is already adjudicated its how I know the ""it's doesn't cost $60000 to bury a..."" comment is definitely true.

He values life so little if it isn't his own. It shows how we weighs life. Like who takes chairty money intended for cancer kids? Someone who sees that money being sent to those kids a pointless because they have cancer. Just like he would find it senseless to spend that much money to bury a soldier.

Just like he likely paid as little as possible to bury his ex wife on the grounds.

It is extraordinarily unlikely he would live to be sworn in, and equally unlikely that JD Vance would.  He's already set the precedent that attempting to have people killed is an acceptable response to an unwelcome election result (and based on completely delusional ideas about fraud, as opposed to actual attempts to purge voter rolls, move or hide ballot boxes, intimidate voters, etc that are already ongoing).  I would fully expect that he would end up reaping the harvest whose seeds he has sown.  

I'm not saying I support or applaud the idea.  I don't support or applaud people getting hit by lightning, but I can observe someone standing on top of a hill waving a metal pole around during a thunderstorm and say ""dude's probably gonna get electrocuted"".  In that vein, I just think he's removed the expectation of civility and peaceful transfer of power from the table, and I also think that he has created an existential threat to the continuance of America as a democracy by his embrace of dictators (not just his favorite, Hitler, but also current ones like Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin) and totalitarianism (as exemplified in his demands for loyalty to him personally instead of the Constitution and the duties of office, and his embrace of Project 2025).  

If you foment an insurrection and get people killed trying to stay in power, why would you expect everyone else to be a better and more law-abiding person than you, faced with the threat of you getting back into the office you committed treason trying to keep the first time you had it?  I mean, almost everyone on the planet IS a better person than Trump, but he has no right to expect them to act like it in a moment of crisis.  Or at all.  He has no moral standing to expect to be protected from the results of his actions.

ltujc7m,"All good points, but I think #2 & #4 are most overlooked in the conventional wisdom. 

I believe that the polls are expecting turn-out among women to wane from the previous cycles where the Dobbs ruling was a significant factor.  This is precisely what was wrong with polling in 2022 midterms and various other state elections since Dobbs. 

You’d think the polls would account for this, but I suspect the thinking is that the Dobbs decision has already had a turn-out impact, and everything forward  will reflect a return to previous cycles.  

I don’t think this will prove to be true.  I think the passion around this issue is just as much a factor as ever, and many women, in many states have yet to log a vote directly on the issue.  

Trump could have adopted a tactic to present a softer stance to dissipate some of the energy on this issue.  But he doubled down and leaned into a pro-life position.  He bragged about Dobbs and made many ridiculous statements on the matter (e.g. everyone, including democrats wanted Roe overturned).

ltulgwi,"Came to say this. The problem with the polls isn’t the answer, it’s the mapping they’ve chosen on how those answers line up with Likely Voters. If you were to project those same answers into all Registered Voters, it would be Harris by miles. 

So what’s the difference? It will have to be first time and infrequent votes, and while there’s no hard evidence, anecdotally as you say college students are putting the effort into voting in their home towns, finding their polling location, getting it done early - something traditionally the 18-34 crowd is terrible at, often being a day late and a dollar short on finding time and knowing how to vote. 

I think the voting totals might show the highest percentage of Registered Voters ever. 

Apparently there were 161 million RVs in 2022 but 168 in 2020 - it dropped between them because a certain number die, some get purged in *normal* cleanups, and some don’t re-register when they move cause they don’t have a strong reason to. A whopping 158million/168m of 2020 voted (94%),  for contrast in Hillary’s election, suppressed enthusiasm led to only 137m/158m (86.7%) voted, about 21m registered-but-not-voting (RBNV) sat out, while last time to throw Trump out only 10milion voters were RBNV. (94% of registered voted)


So if this years registrations go up past 2020 - and this does seem likely, with the way both sides are scrambling their friends to register, we could see, let’s say maybe 96% of registered vote AND the total registered goes up to 175m - that would be about 7 million sitting out but 168m votes cast, ie about exactly 7m more voters. I think that tilts a lot of states real high, and swing states about a solid 51.5/48.5.

Let’s hope!

ltv66u9,"I agree with you about the being skeptical about polling, but mostly because I don’t think pollsters know how to weight anything given the last decade of federal elections. Trump has a way of turning out unreliable voters and he over-performed polling when he was on the ballot in 2016 and 2020. But then 2022, the GOP under-performed polling in the same way after they likely tried to correct for the last few years. So I think the major question is “Will Trump churn out unreliable voters that we miss again like 2016/2020? Or will the younger crowd and women hit the polls hard again like 2022? Or both, and it’s a turnout game?” And I think we just won’t have any idea until Election Day; trying to read the tea leaves every day just stresses me out.

Also, to your quote about Plouffe, he’s saying the same thing you are, but reasoning from the opposite direction. He says most public polls are garbage, yes, but then says it’s because the race is stupid-close. Not that Dems may over-perform. He’s stressing that it’s all a turnout game.

We must live in different universes indeed. I am genuinely excited about Harris specifically, as are many people I know.

Even with LGBT issues, she was one of the first politicians to fight for their rights (before Obama, Biden, etc) and even officiated one of the first homosexual marriages that took place in California. Her economic plans have been evaluated by so many economists and institutions at this point and they argue that it would curb inflation and spur our economy. 

She also has a really interesting way of approaching policy analysis. If you know anything about her record or heard interviews on how she approaches policy and governance, she tends to use all sorts of data to analyze the issue from every angle and determine what underlying factors are leading to the trends. Often her out-of-the box thinking leads her to identify underlying causes that one wouldn't suspect are related to a trend in a specific field (such as the connection between school attendance and murder victims). She also pushes her staff and teams to develop rationales for any ideas they propose. If you've heard interviews with her staff, she asks them really tough questions about why they are suggesting a specific course of action, and wants to see concrete evidence of impact before moving forward with a particular idea. So she has a great balance of trusting and delegating to smart people, but challenging them to justify their advice.

Betting usually happens in the background, but this year, Donald Trump and his running mate Elon Musk have frequently advertised their numbers online, this has caused the number of right-wing bettors that consume ""red-wave"" sources on those platforms to soar. When Trump's betting odds soared in mid-October, nothing fundamentally changed from the beginning of the month, except, well, Elon Musk promoting the platform when Trump took the slightest lead.

4. The oddsmakers have a direct incentive to predict the outcome correctly. They need to balance the flow of money and/or have the favorite win so they don’t end up massively in the hole when it comes time to pay everyone. 

In the example that has been given multiple times about large $10m bets coming in for Trump, if that was enough to move the needle, they would offset that action by dramatically improving the odds for Kamala so they could draw money back to the opposing stance.

If team As # of  voters > team Bs number of voters, team A wins. If not, team b wins. Simple, only 1 factor matters and that is voter numbers

On the betting markets there are 2 factors to determine the odds, 1 is # of betters and the other is the size of the bet 

If team As # of betters > team Bs number of betters, the odds can show that team B is winning because of the factor of  bet size being greater. 

Thus factor throws off the market by accounting for the size of bets, when an election the only thing that matters is the number of voters. It doesn't matter how enthusiastic a single voter is, or how much money they have, every vote is worth 1, every bet is not worth 1, therefore 1 really enthusiastic better betting 10 skews the data.",2024-10-26 05:11:41,2,PoliticalDiscussion,True,1
ltw73fu,"That's actually why they can't interfere with betting odds. Because the odds are determinitive of pay out. You also now have an unknown hand weighing things out which is another thing that skews the results because now it isn't even reflective of what betters want or how confident betters are on their candidate, now it is just about what 1 company needs the odds to be to stay in business. 

It doesn't have to reflect the actual likelihood of a candidate winning, it only has to reflect the amount of money put in - their profit margin. 

I'm sorry, we have gone through the math and now you are saying the house has supernatural knowledge of how voters will really vote (not based on polls) and will be able to manipulate the betting market to reflect reality regardless of money put into the market. You understand how everything you're arguing leads to less accuracy in the market right? Like you're now adding more factors that don't exist in an election. Because now the market isn't just about the number of betters, which BTW is the only factor in an election is the number of voters. Now you've added weighted voting where some voters hold more valuable votes, but now you have introduced a deep state element that will change the tallies to reflect the reality they believe will happen. And are claiming the the voters being weighted and the hand of the deep state are gonna be more accurate than polls that only factor in the number of voters. 

There are too many external factors in betting markets for them to be accurate in an election. Thats just the reality. Doesn't mean you can't bet on them or like them. But they are too easily manipulated to look at them and say they are the most accurate.

So the question becomes, why are people like trump and musk telling you that the most manipulatable ""poll"" is the most accurate. The answer is simple. They want you to believe in those markets so if they lose they can point and say ""no, polymarket said we were up 20% there's no way we lost read claim the election was rigged. The reality is that they are rigging the market that they are going to point to to claim the election is rigged.

ltvad8n,"This is absolutely fucking delusional, its an escalation.  Any attack on Iran by Israel is a major escalation...Not a measured response.  A measured response would have been a strongly worded letter.  

Israel is the aggressor, the U.S. is highly likely to be involved.  Has been involved in previous attacks.  Is currently involved in intelligence gathering on Iran that it shares with Israel, sends aid and weapons to Israel.

Israel is the entity that started the conflict, by illegally militarily occupying Palestine and repeatedly engaging in attacks on Iran.  Committing genocide in Palestine, illegally kidnapping and holding hostage thousands of Palestinians annually.  Illegally seizing territory.  Illegally displacing residents of a country they have no legal right to.

You have Israel assassinating Iranian scientists, stuxnet, Israel targeting Iranian nuclear sites, Israel seizing Iranian shipping.  Israel attacking and assassinating Iranian military and government personnel, sites and equipment in Syria. 

Oct 7th happened after the amending of the 2005 Disengagement Plan and the destruction of hundreds of Palestinian homes and the displacement of Palestinians.  The Knesset saying it would reclaim Greater Israel which includes the entirety of Palestine and Jordan, and Netanyahu at the United Nations with a map of Israel titled the New Middle East that claims all of Palestine for Israel.

And recently the Israeli illegal attack on the Iranian embassy in Syria.  


Lets review...  Israel is in violation of international law militarily occupying Palestine.  Israel has no right to block weapons shipments to Palestine under any international law in existence.  Iran has an inherent right to have trade with Palestine, Lebanon and supply them with weapons.  Israels invasion of Lebanon was and is illegal.  Israel continues to this day to illegally occupy Lebanese territory as well.

Any further military response by Israel is an escalation, not a moderated response.

If Biden had any sense at all, like any sense.  Any marbles rattling around up there in his head.  A single marble.  He would end all aid and weapons to Israel.  And he would have done it a long time ago.",2024-10-26 01:12:57,-4,PoliticalDiscussion,True,1

The end result of their action, is a major escalation.  Israel is the aggressor, they started the conflict.  Not just the regional war, but the recent immediate conflict with Iran.  A measured response would actually be Israel doing absolutely fucking nothing.

Israel is not a liberal democracy.  Its a theocratic apartheid ruled by a terrorist political party.  In order for a country to be considered a democracy everyone has to have representation.  Israel claims Palestine as their territory.  Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza do not have representation in the Knesset, its not a democracy in the slightest.  Likud is a right wing political party founded by the leader of the terrorist group Irgun.  The current Minister of National Security is leader of a right wing terrorist political party founded by members of the Kach terrorist group.  The IDF itself was formed from the terrorist group Haganah.  Benjamin Netanyahu was literally elected to office because he was holding violent rallies calling for the assassination of Prime Minister Rabin with right wing Kahane terrorists due to the fact that he was willing to have peace talks with Palestinians.  And as a direct result Rabin was assassinated.

In 1967?  You mean when Israel illegally invaded Egypt and illegally seized surrounding states territory.  And attacked and killed U.S. service members on the U.S.S. Liberty.  The simple reality is that Israel is a illegitimate terrorist state.

Israel had been committing genocide, displacing Palestinians, refugees were flooding into neighboring states.  Israel was angry that states like Lebanon were not policing the refugees that Israel created.  Palestinians wanted their land and their homes back and were attacking Israel.  Israel illegally invaded Lebanon in 1982 and sent militants into refugee camps to slaughter civilians.  The United Nations classified this as acts of genocide.  Israel then proceeded to cluster bomb residential neighborhoods in Lebanon.  These illegal actions is what caused the formation of Hezbollah.  Israel then illegally seized Lebanese territory and still to this day continues to illegally occupy parts of Lebanon.

In 1987 Israel illegally killed civilian Palestinian workers returning from a refugee camp and Palestinians started to protest by closing shops in Palestine, refusing to travel to Israel to work, and blocked roads in Palestine.  Israel in response illegally sent 80k IDF soldiers into Palestine and slaughtered 1000 Palestinians.  This illegal action is what caused Hamas to be formed.  The only reason Hamas gained control of Gaza was due to Israels illegal assassination of Palestinian leadership, illegal limitation of travel to and from Gaza and the West Bank and the continued illegal seizure of land.  And recently under Biden, U.S. pressure being applied on current PA leadership to resign.

The conflict in Yemen was a domestic conflict, U.S. and Saudi Arabian interference violated the U.N. Charter as well.  So if you are going to complain that the Houthis are backed by Iran then you need to acknowledge the obvious.  Yemen is a member of the Arab League and Israel is committing genocide of the Palestinians, Palestine is a member of the Arab League...

Your argument about whether genocide has been committed by Israel is irrelevant since Israel is a United Nations member.  If Israel chooses it can leave the United Nations.  Then maybe it can stand on its own and use its own definition for the word genocide.

Hamas did not provoke anything.  Israel amended the 2005 Disengagement Plan and illegally seized hundreds of Palestinian homes, illegally displacing hundreds of Palestinians, all while continuing to illegally kidnap and take hostage thousands of Palestinians a year...This was while the Knesset openly declared all of Palestine and Jordan to be seized by Israel.  Israel provoked Hamas...Israel provoked the Palestinians, since its Israel who is the aggressor in every single interaction you can possibly list.

Palestine has a right to attack Israel, Israel has no right under international law to self defense from Palestine.  It has no just cause.  No right to war, jus ad bellum.  Israel is an illegitimate state, the acquisition of territory through use of force has been a violation of international law since before Israel was founded.  Israel has been violating Palestinians territorial integrity since Zionist terrorist groups declared independence in violation of international law.

The Ultra Orthodox Jews?  You mean the anti-Zionist Jews right?  The Jewish people that the Zionists routinely targeted for assassination.

Arab parties in the Knesset have a minority presence and no real political power.  The majority parties are right wing and advocate terrorism and violations of human rights and international law.

Israel ""IS"" a theocracy

Israel destabilizes the entire Middle East and commits genocide, costs American tax payers trillions of dollars, interferes in U.S. domestic politics, and actively sabotages U.S. intelligence gathering to pressure the U.S. into needless war.

Under the 12th Amendment, like with the election of 1876, that throws the election to the House, where each state has one vote.

While a majority of Americans live in a state run by Democrats, a majority of the states themselves are run by Republicans. Each state gets one vote for president in the House, and right now 26 state delegations are GOP-controlled, meaning that a majority of the House would simply vote to put Trump back into the White House, 26-23(Pennsylvania’s delegation is 50/50). All totally legal.”

Why on God’s green earth?? Well…

But it's a self fulfilling prophecy, and a collective action problem; if they didn't obey in advance, the authoritarian wouldn't be able to seize power.

You...you think they're going to tell a random person who calls up about their security plans? I'm sure Adam Schiff is aware of what Trump is saying. I think the staffer was simply taken aback by your question. She may not be privy to the specifics either, but she knew she couldn't tell you regardless and just wanted to politely get you off the phone. There may have been a smoother answer (""I can't discuss this with you, thanks for your concern for the Congressman""), but keep in mind she may not be that experienced. Or she may just not have expected the question you apparently asked because it's not something the public or constituents are entitled to know.

I'm not fully confident Democratic leaders have an effective plan as a group if Trump takes power, and individual plans may be all over the map (and for some may include putting a priority over fighting for the common good over ""their own liberty"")...but I know in their shoes I wouldn't be showing all my cards, and I would also need to see what actually happens first.

ltogmzs,"Here's the thing: An earlier reply mentioned the word 'compassion', and this is precisely what's absent from the psyche of all tyrants and would-be tyrants. 


From a metaphysical perspective, as opposed to a purely sociopolitical one, the entity currently known as 'DJ Trump' shares this appallingly negative trait in common with other such unevolved and abusive entities now in positions of power, among them Putin, Netanyahu and Kim Jong Un. 


In the absence of compassion, their psyches increasingly revolve around themselves alone, as the ever-expanding delusion regarding their own importance in the grand scheme of things takes hold. The effects of such extreme narcissism invariably manifest along the same lines as those of the playground bully, yet as with the bully, the venom that these tyrants perpetually exude conceals a deeply entrenched inferiority complex and an innate cowardice. It is this cowardice, coupled with an habitual egocentric desire to court popularity at any cost, that will, as you have so correctly put it, cause them to do ANYTHING regardless of all ethical considerations to promote themselves; compassion, in all cases, is the last thing on their minds. 


What truly mystifies me is how any human demographic can be so utterly blind to these basic insights as to allow itself to be deceived en masse by such entities; and to compound the matter, the abnormal dynamic of the current US elections is entirely unprecedented, barring what should have been lessons learned in both 2016 and 2020. 


It is unlikely that any MAGA adherent will heed these words or other such warnings, but apart from the hope that a second term of national insanity can somehow be avoided, the day cannot come fast enough when mindless masses are a thing of the past, and humans categorically refuse to have their lives dictated by the whims of a single depraved and grotesque specimen of their own kind.",2024-10-23 05:17:44,1,PoliticalDiscussion,True,-1

You haven’t really been clear about it, but what I gather you’re talking about is the strategy of some Democratic voters of switching their party affiliation so they can vote for the most extreme Republican in the RNC primaries? Is that what you’re trying to talk about?

The basic premise here is that if the RNC is stupid enough to nominate insane primary candidates who have no chance in the general election, the DNC can exploit that mistake by supporting the extreme candidates, knowing that the extremist will lose in the general.

It’s pretty much win-win for everyone this way: you help keep extremists out of office so that more progressive candidates have a chance to impact policy.

lskdeak,"For much of modern history, there has been more or less  a gentlemen’s agreement to not assassinate each other’s head of state due to the problems it would cause, namely inviting retaliatory assassinations. Of course, countries have tried it (e.g. the US with Castro), but the calculus is that it usually isn’t worth the instability and escalation with nations that have modern military capabilities. Heads of state are also much more secure than the leaders of an insurgent organization, making assassination far more difficult even when a desirable option. The same goes for generals ever since warfare has evolved beyond them commanding at the front lines. It’s simply not feasible for even the most resourceful intelligence agencies to conduct the level of covert operations needed to eliminate a meaningful amount of an enemy nation’s military chain of command.

On the other hand, several drug cartels were rendered defunct, splintered, or a shadow of themselves after they lost most of their leadership in a short span of time, a much more feasible task given that they are criminal organizations with significantly less resources than the nations hunting them. The Beltrán-Leyva and Guadalajara cartels lost virtually all of their key leadership within the span of a couple years and effectively ceased to exist. Los Zetas were once among the top players in the game, but fragmentations in its organizational structure after it split from the Gulf Cartel as well as the killings/arrests of all of their founding members and up-and-coming second generation leadership have reduced them to a shell of their former glory. Other cartels like La Familia Michoacana and the Knights Templar centralized too much power among one or two leaders, leading to their collapse when their leaders were eliminated. The big players currently such as the Sinaloa and CJNG cartels have since structured themselves to become more resilient against losses of high ranking leadership, though at the greater risk of creating too many factions within their own organization.

Assuming you're talking about the Beslan incident, you have your facts wrong once again.  Putin did not blow up the school, there were multiple explosions due to bombs rigged up in the gym.

You're correct, it would be stupid.  Israel, however, is not committing war crimes.

No, this is incorrect. Hospitals lose this protection when it is used to hide fighters, store weapons, etc.

Consider the idea that the United States is playing a diplomatic line here.  We know as much as anyone else does that Hamas is seizing it.

Yes, there are some extremists in Israel who are acting contrary to what the government would do. Hamas executes people who do that, usually after torturing them for a length of time.

1 - opposition party needs to have ready a platform they can run on for when the election is called
2 - elections can be called at any time, but have to occur once every 5 years (in the British model you cite)
3 - the party selects its leader without the lengthy primary process - in other words, one has to be an active party member to have a say in the party leadership, not just any joe schmo who ""registers"" as a party member
4 - as the opposition needs to be ready at any time, they also need to maintain a shadow cabinet who can form the new government should they win
5 - party leader and cabinet must win their local seat to be part of the government - if the party leader can't win their seat, party needs to select another leader. This works in Parliamentary systems, the US is different.

Overall, the US system needs an overhaul that needs to start with voting reform that encourages greater participation, diminishes gerrymandering, and puts in place a system like ranked choice voting. This will help diminish the impact of political extremes and ensure party in power has policies more closely aligned with the true desires of the public, which will give them a more clear mandate to address the more tricky government reforms.

If you haven't heard Joe Biden parrot this idea--and eschew actual progressive policy--on CSPAN, you probably don't know that ""the green economy"" is simply him sticking to this conservative plan of 2005.

But if you go digging into the data for the polls, most have a few problems. The recent times Florida poll that had Trump up by 15 also had him winning 18-29 by 13 points for example. Polls are also notoriously bad at predicting turnout, both total and demographical, as seen with the 2022 senate elections or the presidential election in 2016. 

Exit polls for the most recent election in 2022 and the results of special elections since, the Iowa register poll, the Marquette law poll for Wisconsin, and Havard youth poll are the only things proven to be incredibly reliable. And those paint a very good picture for Harris and the dems in general. A 4 to 10 point shift towards the democrats on average compared to 2020 seems to be the normal.

lrddsls,"Here's the thing... there is NOTHING to criticize about how the campaign has been doing.  It's the best campaign I've ever witnessed, and I worked for George McGovern in Iowa.  

Bottom line, these are not ordinary times.  There is nothing at all about this process that isn't under attack.  I personally believe many foreign powers are engaged in our social media and messaging.

I was also hoping that the undeniable superiority of one candidate over the other, combined with the continuing failure of that other candidate to even achieve coherence, would have created a nice polling space from which to get a breather.  When that didn't happen, after the debate debacle, I just hardened.

There are a few facts that help me sleep at least a little.

1.  The pollster's probability of modeling the electorate accurately in 2024 is less likely than it was in '16,'18'20' and '22.  And they BLEW it in each of those cycles.  So, I've been watching the polls for trends, and a couple recently look flat, or a bit worse, but that is after a CONSTANT, if variable in rate, growth by the democratic ticket.  But if you can tell me how pollsters are reaching voters under 35, I'll try to believe you.  They're uncountable, imo.

2.  The disparity between the senate candidates and the top of the ticket makes no sense.   Granted the GOP has once again fielded a bunch of turd candidates, many of whom don't live in the states in which they are running.  Still, I don't think anyone believes there are 8% of AZ voters who will vote Trump/Gallego... So, there's that.

3.  Finally, open your eyes outside the media bubble.  She's raised almost twice the money he has, She has 4 times the number of volunteers he has.  His electorate is FIXED.  It is what it is.  Hers is potentially limitless...The turnout in '08 blew the pundit's minds, even though there were hints....

lrg6x7q,"I’m also curious what exactly they’ve done wrong? 

Some other things to call out that they’ve done right:
* Revolutionized digital and social media campaigning - to reach both young voters, new voters, and voters not tuned into legacy media. They are quite literally the next iteration of Bernie and AOC’s digital campaigning game. It is next level, fast, and much of it is relatable, human, and going viral.
* Hitting all levels of the media circuit: balancing legacy media (but not as much) with high volume channels and mediums to reach disengaged and new voters. Kamala has a lock on those super tuned into politics who don’t want Trump. And she’s not going to peal away his diehard base. Her campaign is focused on new voter turnout, including women, and youth. 
* Multiple stops in swing states, and not just big city centers: she corrected Hillary’s mistake in 2016 (actually a couple of those including debate approach, not calling half the country deplorable, but this is the biggest one). 
* Campaign messaging: the entire campaign is about bringing the country together. Being a leader for everyone (especially the middle class/working class).

>Just an aside Trump’s message has never changed since 2015, it’s all doom and gloom and only HE can fix it. It’s hate and fear mongering, and while that can work as a populist approach, there are many in this country that are tired of it. We’re tired in general. Most people remember 2020 and don’t want to go back to hate/fear watching the news everyday. It’s exhausting. BUT, as OP stated Kamala has to toe the line, provide ample strategy, policy points, and motivate voters all while not talking down Biden’s achievements but still providing some idea of change for Americans who are hurting or scared by economics, immigration, geo politics, and natural disasters, etc. That’s a wild tight rope act. 

Please, what has the campaign done wrong? I am failing to see it. For once in years, I am not disappointed by the Democrats approach.

Trump has never so much as hinted at an actual point to his crusade, except for 'get power, avoid jail'. There's no politics except for the cookie-cutter fascism-lite that comes naturally to anyone too stupid to understand why the country is falling apart.

You're absolutely right in how you lay out the mindset and devotion of the MAGA base. But I think you're underestimating one important point:


Trump's *charisma.*


Donald Trump may be an aging, narcissistic, misogynistic, criminal, pathological liar. He may even be something of a fool at times. But he is not stupid when it comes to PR, branding, and messaging.


*Trump is uniquely excellent at branding himself and working a crowd.*


It's his biggest asset. He knows how make populist appeals to the masses, and he has the charisma to tell entertaining lies often enough that many believe that he's telling the truth.


He's definitely losing some of his luster as his age starts to catch up to him, but he is VERY good at speaking and working crowds, as well as controlling the narrative - even if he does so by constantly lying.


*I just don't see the MAGA movement lasting long without that figure and voice to consistently rally around.*


You can't just swap Trump out for some other guy and expect the MAGA train to keep rolling forward - at least not in its current state, size, or enthusiasm. Most MAGA affiliated down ballot candidates (governors, senators, etc) do *terrible* at the ballot. From Ron DeSantis to Kari Lake you can't just adopt Trump's messaging, *without Trump's voice,* and expect to win. On the contrary: they lose. Consistently. Just look at 2022.


I don't see other potential MAGA cult leaders picking up where Trump left off in a way that appeals to a wide enough portion of his base to keep the movement alive as THE dominant Republican force. Because the only thing that Republicans hate more than progress is losing. And Trump surrogates have a proven track record of losing. Because they may be MAGA, *but they aren't Trump.*


You capture the MAGA voter mindset well, though, and I'm curious just as to where they will steer themselves once Trump fades.

In that case it feels really corny to spend any breath saying that a claim made about Trump's plan, on abortion for example, is ""false"" because he never *said* he would go for a national abortion ban. It takes us for absolute idiots to believe that isn't in the cards should he win.

lvdowl3,"Ellen: I think it really depends on what kind of an event it is that we’re fact-checking. 

Our reporters listen to *a lot* of speeches and interviews by the candidates, and they get very familiar with their stump speeches. When it comes to a major rally, we’ve usually heard and fact-checked whatever a candidate is repeating, so we’re listening for anything new or newsworthy.

For live fact-checking a debate, it’s a similar process, but we spend a lot of time before hand prepping things we suspect the candidates might say. (Not to brag, but our team doc to prep for the Trump-Harris debate was 100+ pages long.) One group on our team works on immediately sharing what we have prepped on social media or [our live blog,](https://www.politifact.com/article/2024/sep/10/presidential-debate-live-fact-check-harris-trump/) while another group starts working on new claims that come up so we can get a [fact-check](https://www.politifact.com/article/2024/sep/11/2024-presidential-debate-fact-check-harris-trump/) out quickly. 

And then there’s big breaking news events, like the Baltimore bridge collapse or the Trump assassination attempt in July or Hurricane Helene or Election Day, where we can’t really prepare. Breaking news can create an information gap as everyone is scrambling to get answers, and social media loves to fill that gap with misinformation. 

In these cases, we’re often in triage mode, trying to address the most serious, harmful or prevalent misinformation spreading online. That includes things like false claims about [FEMA aid](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/06/tweets/fema-gives-750-to-help-hurricane-victims-with-supp/) might dissuade survivors from getting help or disinformation that [discourages people from voting](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/nov/03/tweets/this-video-about-ballot-fraud-is-not-from-the-fbi/). It can be difficult since there might not be a ton of information available at the moment; For example, we waited to publish fact-checks about the shooter who attempted to assassinate Trump until his identity was confirmed by authorities. But during breaking news, we’re more concerned about getting it right than getting it first. ",2024-11-04 16:06:37,4,politics,True,0

We can’t know what to make of the numbers — whether they are big or small, or significant or not — if we’re looking at the data in isolation, as the majority of commentators have presented it.
> 
> The conversation around Black voters is an example of one theme I plan to explore in this year-long column for The Post: how our instincts about data can lead us to draw the wrong conclusions.
> 
> As is often the case, we have yet to ask two necessary questions of the data: “Compared with what?” and “Out of how many?”
> 
> For the movement among Black voters to matter, it must mean a net loss for Harris and a net gain for Trump. When we compare Black voters only to themselves, and no other group, it creates the appearance that this is the case. When we change the comparison to all voting blocs, the picture changes.

luqf980,"People who hate it when prognosticators are wrong don't seem to understand how probabilities work. Weathermen get criticized more now, when they can give pretty accurate probabilities, than they did in the past, when no one expected precision. A 60% chance of rain means a substantial chance it won't rain, but a lot of people treat 60% like it's 100%.

Scientists who try to foresee what will happen with the climate crisis or the COVID pandemic have the same problem. They talk about probabilities but people get mad when they aren't 100% accurate. And then they decide they are ""full of shit.""

As Nate Silver consistently discusses, predicting presidential elections is much harder than predicting the weather. We only have a presidential election every four years, so even the entire history of polls is a relatively small sample size with high margin of error.

That has nothing to do with criminal records (and also realize, by definition, illegals will have 'criminal records' by being in the US illegally.  For this conversation I will assume you are talking about actual criminal records).  It has to do with catching whatever illegals, putting them on ships and planes, and 'returning them'.  It lasted one year under Eisenhower, returned one million people including mistakenly rounding up American citizens.  

JD Vance has re-enforced this by telling the NYT recently he thinks it is 'reasonable' to deport around a million a year.  (Which was of course far different then what he said in 2012).

First and foremost, I'd like to thank all **300** of you who entered a prediction over the past week. I know the form was a bit long, so I appreciate those who took the time to fill it out. Future contests will hopefully be a bit quicker to work through.

With that said, here are some interesting facts about our predictions:

* A majority of entrants believe that the Democrats will take the House (83%) and Senate (55%)

* The closest House race is AZ-06, where challenger Kirsten Engel wins over Rep. Ciscomani (158-142)

* A vast majority of entrants believe Vice President Kamala Harris will be the next President (90%)

* Of those who believe Harris will win, the average EV number is 308; the most common is 319.

* Of those who believe Trump will win, the average EV number is 310; the most common is 312.

* Entrants barely believe that South Dakota will pass its abortion-related ballot measure (151-149)

* The most common expectation for the number of states with a margin of victory under 1% is **three**.

* The top 3 expected states with the closest margin of victory are North Carolina (31%), Arizona (21.3%), and Georgia (13.7%).

If there are any other questions about what our entrants predicted, feel free to reply to this comment and I'll attempt to answer them!

Trump, on the other hand, will jail anyone who disagrees with him, and at the top of that list are people like Cornell West and all of us who agree that innocent people deserve to be treated with dignity and worth and not be bombed and unjustly murdered by the IDF. Trump has plans to round up, toss into camps or deport millions of people. Our right and ability to protest will end on Jan 20 if Trump takes office.

Trump is in this race in part simply because the Democrats were always going to take it on the chin simply because they came in and had to clean up the Post-COVID mess. And Harris is in this race in part simply because she has Trump as an opponent. If the Republican Party had picked a non-MAGA candidate, Democrats probably wouldn't have great odds at the White House this term.

On the other hand: If Harris is able to win, there is a good chance that she could get credit if the economy does well for the next few years, a la Obama 2012.

Major analyses of these undervotes show that Bush would have still taken the state by around 400 votes.

Gore won Florida on a statewide recount, which would have been too cost prohibitive and time intensive to perform under the circumstances, was not requested by Gore's legal team, was not ordered as a remedy by the Florida SC, and was not an option under any circumstance in 2000 when the election was called for Bush.

lu0xspr,"Does anyone think that any Gaza protest voters would ultimately have not voted for Biden/Harris anyway, even if there wasn’t the Gaza war? There is always a contingent of the population, every election year, who fit the “blue” profile but are angry at the Democrats for being “too corporate,” have “both sides are the same” opinions, and are mad that their ideal progressive candidate isn’t on the ballot instead.

To look at some of the most vocal pro-Palestine supporters: College students - would those college students have voted anyway? Maybe, but also maybe not - getting college students to vote is a huge uphill battle in itself. There’s also the smug “I need to vote with my conscience” people who think that voting is a marriage proposal or contract and take themselves way too seriously. Then the accelerationist, contrarian types who foolishly think “things have to get worse before they get better.”

I’m not saying “we don’t need their votes” but what I am saying is these types of people will usually find some sort of excuse to not vote. If the candidate’s platform isn’t 100% what THEY want (and they think they’re the smartest person in the room), they stay home, and because candidates are running to lead a country of 100+ million people, there’s no way ANY candidate will appeal to each individual person exactly, so they’ll just never vote.",2024-10-27 15:03:05,67,politics,True,1

That student debt relief didn’t help **me**.” There’s a chunk of progressives who are 100% operating in the worst of bad faith because Biden didn’t bend over backwards to suck them off…and think that it’s reasonable, or that it’ll “send a message” to have not thrown support behind him, and that the same will be accomplished by pretending that Harris isn’t going to do enough either. 

Nah-the rest of us are just gonna look at y’all like the brats you are, regardless of your age, and we’ll look down on you for good reason and belittle you like the misbehaving children you are.

There is no good reason to vote for Trump. There’s no good reason to sit this out. Gas prices, groceries, your taxes, your 401Ks, your stocks…none of that shit is a good enough reason to vote for that fascist bastard, or to withhold your vote from the other candidate, who’s laid out “Hey, it’s not perfect, but I’ve got a recipe we can follow and make adjustments to so we can make some good efforts at solving some of these problems. Won’t be without it’s work, and again, it won’t be perfect, but it’s there, and is better than anything republicans have offered.”

Remember “Repeal and replace” for the ACA? Shit’s been law for years, and they finally gave up because it’s more popular to have coverage and subsidies than to let Americans die without healthcare, or to let them go from having minor issues that could be solved at taxpayer cost now…than have the rest of us pay out the nose later through jacked up premiums that you can’t be insulated from because the government isn’t helping pay for it. 

We need a solid 8-12 years of solid left leadership to correct the fuckups of past Republican leadership. Griping that gas was slightly cheaper when nobody was driving during the pandemic and demand forced prices to fall isn’t going to fix anything.

I really enjoy your podcast with Sammy and appreciate you doing this AMA. I fully believe in the 13 keys and look forward to your prediction being correct again this year.  


I'm sure you are familiar with Aaru but for those who are not, I've added some information and article link below.  


Do you have any thoughts on their belief that  ""No traditional poll will exist by the time the next general election occurs,” Fink said in an interview with Semafor. “There are massive issues when you’re using real people. You never know if someone is telling the truth.”  


More on Aaru: ""For election results, Aaru uses census data to replicate voter districts, creating AI agents essentially programmed to think like the voters they are copying. Each agent is given hundreds of personality traits, from their aspirations to their family relationships. The agents are constantly surfing the internet and gathering information meant to mimic the media diets of the humans they’re replicating, which sometimes causes them to change their voting preferences.  


Congratulations on qualifying for the Senior Olympics next year by the way. My dad competed in Masters T&F so and I have fond memories of the events.

The US is badly losing in Ukraine, so it's hard to understand how anyone could call that a foreign policy victory.

I clearly did so in my final predication in the Washington Post on September 23rd 2015, which said nothing about the popular vote, but only predicted Trump's victory. In the same interview I predicted his impeachment which made sense only if I was predicting his election. I similarly predicted his election in a subsequent Fox News interview which is still up on YouTube and you can watch my prediction. I received a letter of congratulations from Donald Trump and won the Stekler award for courage in forecasting.

If you've been doing something for around 150 years, it's hard to break the habit.

If we average the White and Black populations in AL the political leaning is roughly 55% republican, 10% neutral, and 35% democratic. However the white population leans republican (70%), but the black population more heavily leans democratic (80%).

The make up AL senate is 77% republican, 23% democratic, the AL house is 72% and 28%, and the 6/7 (86%) of Al representatives in the US house are republicans. These all skew heavily republican compared to the political leaning of the population.

The skewing of the US house representation, combined with other southern states, impacts the control of the house.

2. Paying Taxes and being compelled to speak in court are both powers that are in the states interest for maintaining a balanced and functional government. 

I think the distinction is relevant because of the consequences:

People don't need licenses? Chaos and crashes on public roads. 

Don't have to pay taxes? The government can't be funded. 

Free to refuse to testify? The government loses the ability to enforce Laws. 

In comparison, if you are not required to vote, the result is that the only people whose voices are heard, are people who want their voices to be heard. 

That's the ideal, of course. 

There are about 4 types of people currently not voting: 

1. People that would vote if they could, but can't get off work, or are being removed from voter roles, or any other voter suppression issues.
2. People that legally can't because they are felons, even though they've served their time.
3. People that aren't voting as a protest.
4. People that don't care enough to vote. 

Mandating voting leaves Felons locked out, but technically fixes the others. But it's a bandaid. 

If we implement reforms, restore the right to vote of Felons, make election day a national holiday, guarantee access to a polling place, implement automatic voter registration, and any other great legislation we could pass, we reduce that group to only two groups:

1. People that aren't voting as a protest.
2. People that don't care enough to vote. 

Do we really feel like it's good for the nation to mandate those groups show up? At best, it's an inconvenience for millions of people, at worst it effectively adds random chance and extra bloat to our polls as voters that don't care either leave it blank, or answer effectively randomly.",2024-10-16 14:44:48,-1,politics,True,1

We actually had such protection on the Voting Rights Act Preclearance.  That was dismantled by SCOTUS a few years back, Judge Roberts is proud of it.

One of the key provision of Preclearance was that on states with a history of discrimination changes to the voting rules need to be pre-clear with a judge before going into effect and not changes where allowed a few months before the election.  Instead of the system we have now in which new rules are introduced with the express intention to tie thing in litigation.

I do not believe NPR is a voice of the current American administration which is how it would be if it was controlled by the federal government. I do not think NPR'S relationship to the American government is the equivalent of AJ's to the Qatari, despite funding from the national broadcasting act.

lutykm7,"Some bad news. Marist polls dropped which pulled Trump's average down badly in the rust belt. Marist looks like they were a few points off the mark in 2020, but the Trump-mentum in the polls has definitely stalled out in this last week, at least in the northern region. Michigan is sinking further underwater quickly, Wisconsin is down again, and PA is now just barely a fractional win for Trump.

Allan Lichtman is gloating that his prediction of a Harris win is going to be right because the female vote is so heavily lopsided in the early vote. He's not wrong about the vote. Many swing states have a 10 point higher vote among women. The split of men/women are almost identical to what they were in 2020 swing states, which didn't help Trump then. And some polls in recent weeks have shown women are equally as skewed to Harris as men are to Trump. With an equal skew on either side, women voting in bigger numbers just mathematically means a Harris win. The numbers I looked at earlier show women are not so big on Harris in Georgia, but there's about an equal skew in the rust belt trio and in North Carolina.

I think Trump peaked too early. He got momentum like two weeks ago, but expecting that to sustain for three full weeks was a tall order.

Megyn Kelly had the Emerson polling guy on yesterday, who gave a pretty good analysis. He said he still thinks there may be a ""shy Trump"" vote in the polls. And he's not convinced there's any hidden Harris vote. He thinks Michigan is Harris' strongest state. And he said what I've said in recent weeks, that Wisconsin is notoriously underpolled for Trump, it's always been his strongest rust belt state, and he expects it's the one where Trump has the best chances in this year. He said, in their polling, the white male Wisconsin voters just seem to lie about not supporting Trump in their polls even when they do. The Emerson guy definitely thought North Carolina was locked up for Trump, and understood why Harris was cutting ad spending. He also said Arizona is swinging in Trump's corner because immigration is the #1 issue there, unlike other states where it's the economy. He thought Nevada would be tough for Trump to pull out. I think he felt pretty good about Georgia. And Pennsylvania, seemed like it was too close to call I think.

Some other CNN type reports I saw though. Their polling guy said no candidate has ever been underpolled 3 elections in a row in the last 50 years. So it would be statistically unlikely for Trump to be undercounted in polling again.",2024-10-31 15:58:04,3,Conservative,True,1

I had briefly worried back when Biden dropped out and endorsed Kamala Harris to take his place as the nominee that we were still too misogynist and sexist of a nation as a whole to elect a woman. But then when I saw all the enthusiasm for her campaign I wasn’t afraid of that anymore. Now that fear is coming back as we enter the home stretch. I hope my initial concern is just wrong and we do the right thing here.

Even if she *somehow* did and was removed from office via the 25th amendment, Walz has some military experience, albeit no combat experience. Trump by contrast, has nothing resembling such experience, and of the two current candidates is far more likely to be 25thed out of office.

I've seen a lot of ideas on this post that seem unlikely, but this absolutely takes the cake.

Edit: Actually, the 25th amendment *also* has a section where it describes how a VP can be appointed that requires the consent of both houses of congress. If we have a Harris presidency, the idea of *both* houses having a republican majority are so low as to be laughable. So even in a hypothetical situation where Harris is removed via the 25th amendment, that same amendment virtually guarantees that Trump could not be added as VP.",2024-11-03 21:33:46,3,PoliticalDiscussion,True,0

lvcorvb,"I wish I shared your optimism. I don't disagree with your analysis, but I have too much Trump trauma to accept the hopium dose. My one hesitancy about making inferences is that PA, WI, and MI don't have restrictive abortion bans. IA does. Ohio and Kansas are pretty good about abortions, so those other polls you pointed out are definitely hopeful signs. The Selzer poll is *good* for Harris, but it shifted for her because of independent women who are (probably) motivated by abortion. It's tempting to assume independent women will behave the same way across the Midwest, but abortion could potentially be *slightly* less of a motivating factor in states that don't have bans. In many Midwestern states, there is also the split ticket option to vote for Trump and Democrats down ballot to protect abortion rights. Iowans don't really have that option. It's rare for voters to split tickets these days, but it can happen enough to sway the election. 

That said, there are no useful polls coming out of Wisconsin. The lack of outlier polls there is statistically improbable, suggesting herding. There's not a lot that can be learned from those polls (outside of digging into the cross tabs, which all agree that Harris is doing well with women, though it's hard to guage how many of them are likely voters), so the next best thing we have is the Selzer result, which obviously looks really bad for Trump. If the Harris campaign can make the case that abortion bans are bad for the entire nation, then Selzer's Iowa results are obviously transferable to other states. It's an easier case to make in a place like Iowa, but voters across the entire country are persuadable. 

The other gold standard poll (from NYT/Sienna) isn't as rosy for Harris in the Midwest, but they are good for her in the sun belt. People are arguing that they oversampled rural voters. I'll be honest; I haven't dug into the cross tabs yet, so I couldn't say if it's just a hopium dose or if rural voters really were oversampled. 

Either way, the Selzer poll is just one of many. It's the best one. However, even the best polls that take the biggest and most accurate samples *should* be wrong in roughly 5% of cases (assuming they all use the same methodology, reach enough people to use a 95% confidence interval, and publish a high enough volume of results). I don't personally think this one is wrong by more than 4 or 5 points. I just can't be sure. I'm also not sure if independent women from Iowa tell us everything that we need to know about how the votes will shake in the other Midwestern states. Selzer suggested the possibility of a Harris landslide, and a few other polls (that clearly aren't herding) from Kansas and Ohio offer more good evidence in favor of Harris. A landslide was always possible, but now it feels even more likely. I just don't want to get my hopes up because this optimistic interpretation of the Selzer poll does come with a few small caveats.

Anyway, since people have been burned before by hating on Selzer, I'm not going to be the one to do it. She's probably, to some degree, correct about a surge toward Harris. Only time will tell how widespread and significant that surge is.",2024-11-03 21:33:46,1,PoliticalDiscussion,True,-1

lvggbtr,"Yeah, a little. Historically, the vp pick helps marginally in the presidential race, and the presidential race helps relatively substantially with down ballot races. Ohio might be something like +9 in favor of Trump when it'd otherwise have been R+8 without Vance. (Idk if these will be the final results. R+8 is the 2020 result; that's why i chose these numbers. Im not trying to make an actual prediction here.) If Trump wins Ohio by 9, then Sherrod Brown has to hope for *a lot* of split ticketing in order to win. Split ticketing is rare in today's climate, but it does happen. Since the senate race is polling so tightly relative to the presidential race in ohio, we know that split ticketing is probably going to happen, and Brown just has to hope that it's enough to put him over the edge. Technically R+9 is higher hill to climb for Brown than R+8, but it's not nothing when the race seems to be so close. At the end of the day, if it really does end up coming down to a single point or so against Brown (which is totally possible), we can say that Vance may have made a difference.

I’m just explaining to you that they are whole people with real thoughts, not just brainless puppets doing what a husband and a church tell them to do.

Having said that, I think you are falling prey to the right wing misinformation campaign on some of these points.  And i'm not saying that dems don't put their own spin on things, but the difference is still night and day as far as outright lies go.

Republicans are anti war only when it suits their current needs, generally that means when they are not the party in office.  The cry ""war hawk"" every time the dems are in office and then when you look back in history, it is them who have ballooned the deficit every single term with foreign engagements and military spending.  It's all right there on paper, you just have to get off the misinformation diet and go find it.  GOP generally always wants to increase military spending more than democrats and criticized biden for not spendung enough at points.

I agree Kamala and the democrats (barring bernie) are absolutely terrible at communicating details during speeches and debates but they are still miles ahead of Trumps stream of outright lies. You can look up what was in the immigration/border bill the republicans didnt pass.  The point is moot anyway because if anyone truly wanted to crack down on illegal immigration hard, they would target businesses who employ them with severe consequences.  None of the powers that be do that because they know it's extremely useful to have a plethora of cheap laborers and doing so would shit all over the economy.  Trump doesn't care at all about immigrants, he mareied several and emplpys 1000s.

luzn8pe,"IMO, foreign-controlled apps (like TikTok, or any new app) shouldn’t be allowed to have political content. It makes us too vulnerable to foreign interference. 

The content you described that’s “meant to appeal to a certain demographic” (low-info women voters who don’t understand Dobbs) has made me very uncomfortable in this election cycle. FTR I’m a registered Dem & pro choice, but the fearmongering propaganda & outright deception is wrong & will ultimately harm the party. Harris can’t “codify Roe” & there’s no risk Trump will “ban abortion & birth control & track women’s periods,” either. Abortions have increased post-Dobbs largely due to the abortion pills now being distributed widely without proper medical oversight. But regardless, no POTUS can federalize abortion now that SCOTUS ruled it’s a matter of state law. Healthcare is regulated at the state level, except drugs/ devices which get federal approval. 

I’m concerned women will feel deceived & disappointed & it’ll do longterm damage to our party. 
In states where repro rights are an issue, we should be encouraging people to take STATE action & help them to do so. We should fund non-profits to facilitate this, too. 

If a Dem POTUS could “codify Roe,” obviously they would’ve done it already. But they can’t. Without socialized healthcare, it’s impossible to make ANY procedure a “fundamental right” because it involves a third-party provider performing a procedure. You can’t force doctors & hospitals to perform it, & what about people who can’t afford it? We can’t put government-funded abortion clinics in every jurisdiction in the country before we offer basic healthcare to all citizens. 

Surely, we can all agree that the right to stay alive & healthy is more basic than the right to abortion.

I throughly recognize that if trump wins elon buying Twitter played a BIG part in it.

I would agree that social media and our elections overall need to be better regulated. However how that's done is quite tricky there is almost no way to do it that doesn't go directly against free speech which I also think is important.

Ok this is where you can down vote me. Just like elon buying Twitter helped trump.....Twitter clearly helped biden win in 2020 and they clearly helped biden all throughout covid and the hunter laptop.

So whichever side held the power used it for no good....Twitter used it to sway the election for joe and elon is using it to sway the election for trump. 

It's not fair when either side does it.

luc9dr5,"Semi Presidential systems have a President and a Prime Minister with almost always the Prime Minister handling domestic policy and being appointed by the Parliament or Congress. The President in these systems are elected by the people and handle foreign policy and head the executive government. 

That is ideal to me. It makes it hard for dictatorship by 1 leader to emerge and keeps continuity of power in foreign affairs for the duration of a Presidential term. It also creates stability and holds the Parliament more accountable for economic and domestic issues instead of them attempting to blame it on the President and it empowers the Parliament to have more ways to remove the President.

France, Ukraine, Poland, Russia, Lithuania, Romania de-facto Serbia and many more nations have this system. 

France's way is arguably the best of this with more checks and balances for the fact that if the President is removed or dies in office he/she is replaced by the Senate leader who has only acting powers until elections are held. This then makes it way more difficult for a Prime Minister and his cabinet to launch a coup against the President because their man the Prime Minister wont become Acting President which can have some powers until election. 

Putin for instance was first a Prime Minister then when Yeltsin was pressured to resign Putin became Acting President for 3 months before new elections were mandated to happen within 90 days. In those months he had a lot of power and then won the election.

And on that note. Putin while running an authortarian government had a longer road to total power than say Trump would need if he or let us ever say someone smarter but more dangerous than him were to be elected President of the United States. Why do I say that? because Fully Presidential Systems which only the US and most nations in Latin America do give insane degrees of autonomy and power to the President. Only in Brazil and like Chile do the Courts act as a safe guard to prevent total dictatorships. Putin when he first became President did not have absolute power and never got that till about his 2nd term and for sure during his 3rd term. Putin had powerful allies he made and then he even had to surrender the Presidency to Medvedev but it worked out because Medvedev was pro Putin and had the same ideas of how to run Russia.

My point is authortarian government in Russia factually requires more of a mass popular movement and a majority of the Government Congress members. Case in point 2 former Russian Prime Ministers under Putin turned against him and 1 of them still speaks out against him. They were all under his 1st or 2nd term.

Trump as President legally speaking has an easier route to becoming a total autocrat he is only hindered by term limits via the Constitution and how hard that is to change and how hard it is for either side to win a strong enough majority to change the laws. However, the position of US President gives the President absolute power on law enforcement and military means so coup becomes easier.

However, to answer your question in a Semi Presidential system I believe the Prime Minister should be popular among the elected officials who majority select him/her. The President should be a populist since they are elected by mass popular vote. The reason the PM should not also by a populist is because it may yield cult following usurping of power. 


With regards to full Parlimentary systems they are the worst in my opinion as far as Democratic effiiency can go. A Presidential system with a weak President term limit or limits and strong judiciarcy and legislature is better if you ask me. However, it depends on how the vote is counted. In a country like Spain coalition governments are often needed thereby reducing the power of the Prime Minister who almost always is from the ruling party. Israel is another example were the Prime Minister party always has a plurality usually but never an absolute majority thus needs coalition partners.",2024-10-29 11:40:28,2,PoliticalDiscussion,True,1
luh7p4o,"The Russian president has some powers that are a bit too strong. If the president's nominee for prime minister is rejected thrice, the president can dissolve the Duma. They don't have to be three different candidates. There is no point in the process that the Duma can insist on their own candidate if the president's choice fails. The president can unilaterally sack a prime minister and I believe dismiss a minister as well. They can veto a law and require 2/3 to override, and their term limit, until 2020, was two consecutive terms, not absolute. They name the judges, set military policy, they serve 6 year terms ever since 2012. They can make decrees so long as it is not against the law or constitution as opposed to just issuing regulations where laws authorize them. In a system of government with such weak democracy to begin with, it was very vulnerable to autocratic capture to begin with and had an unduly powerful president on top of it since 1993.

But the day of the election does have to be set by the National Congress.

And your comments on Trump - I am sorry, but do you think he should get away with this crimes? He has been convicted by a jury of his peers. Let’s break it down, and another poster did this already so copying from that person:

1. Trump has admitted to having no plan.
2. Trump is a convicted felon. A law breaker does *not* uphold the law, and logically, should not be trusted to uphold it.
3. Trump purposefully had his own elected officials shoot down a bi-partisan border bill, for the sole purpose of maintaining a TALKING POINT.
4. Trump added $8.4 TRILLION to the deficit.
5. Trump added more to the deficit than ANY OTHER PRESIDENT IN HISTORY, aside from Obama. In a single term. Obama outpaced him by slightly over a trillion, meaning Trump nearly raked in as much debt in *one term* as Obama did in two.
6. He is a pathological liar, incapable of keeping any of his campaign promises. He lied about the wall. Lied about helping the average American, and passed tax cuts solely for the wealthy. Lied about a health care plan. How could anyone LOGICALLY believe he’s going to do any of the things he claims, when he had 4 years to do *something* other than golf??
7. He retained classified documents, in his private estate, without proper clearance, and refused to return them. This could be all sorts of security breaches, we, the public, don’t have a fucking *clue* about. Logically speaking, someone who STEALS GOVERNMENT PROPERTY, even if it isn’t highly classified information, should not be in any government office, where they’ll have a chance to do it again.
8. He tried to forcibly overthrow a fair and democratic election. If he is incapable of accepting the results of our democratic process, then he should not even be allowed to run for president. Point blank. If you are running for any office which uses a democratic process, then you should be willing/able to accept the results of that process. If you can’t, then you shouldn’t even be a nominee at that point, because that shows that you have no interest in what is best for the people, nor the peoples ideals.
9. It was discovered that Russian propaganda was purposefully targeting the Clinton campaign, to aid his run for presidency. It should go without saying that anyone with logic, or hell, basic common sense, should NOT want their ruler to be associated in any way shape or form, with a fascist dictator. Yet, these people vote for a man who is buddy buddy with one of the most oppressive dictators of this era.
10. Trump openly *mocks* his own supporters. How can you logically believe that a person who mocks you, a BULLY, could have anyone’s best interests in mind? Why would you willingly hire a bully, to look after the lives and well being of an entire country? There is no logic or reason to that.

He has also claimed that immigrants who have committed crimes have ""bad genes""""

Wikipedia on his campaign:

>""As with his previous presidential campaigns, Trump's 2024 campaign has regularly espoused anti-immigrant nativist fearmongering, racial stereotypes, and dehumanized immigrants. In his rhetoric, Trump has blurred the distinction between legal and illegal immigrants, and has promised to deport both. Trump has repeatedly claimed that undocumented immigrants are subhuman, stating they are ""not people"", ""not humans"", and ""animals"". At rallies, Trump has stated that undocumented immigrants will ""rape, pillage, thieve, plunder and kill"" American citizens, that they are ""stone-cold killers"", ""monsters,"" ""vile animals"", ""savages"", and ""predators"" that will ""walk into your kitchen, they'll cut your throat"" and ""grab young girls and slice them up right in front of their parents"". Trump's dehumanizing anti-immigrant rhetoric regularly features details of young women allegedly killed by Hispanic male assailants while ignoring male victims. Studies find no evidence that immigrants commit crimes at higher rates than native-born Americans, and Trump has not provided any evidence to back up his claims.""

""All the scum we have to deal with that hate our country,” “That’s a bigger enemy than China and Russia.… Everyday Americans like Cindy are living in fear all because Kamala Harris decided to empty the slums and prison cells of Caracas, and many other places. Happening all over the world.” “Every country, you know, prison populations all over the world are down. Crime all over the world is down.

It proposes reclassifying tens of thousands of federal civil service workers as political appointees in order to replace them with people loyal to the president. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_2025)

The plan also calls for ending the semi-independence of federal agencies and putting them under direct control of the President. For instance, it would have Trump directing the DOJ who to prosecute.

The tough immigration plan that the Senate had agreed to was approved by Biden.  It showed good faith to all Americans that this was a real effort to stop illegal immigration, but to also improve the opportunity and shorten the time needed for legal entry.  In addition, Biden/Harris had negotiated with Central American countries so that they would also help to slow down the flow of immigrants.  Working on an issue from several points is better than what the GOP wants - to close the borders and kick out all immigrants - legal or illegal.

After the election, Harris had discussions with the fracking companies and learned more about it and why it remained viable at this time.

We need an entire set of gun laws. Focusing on assault weapon buybacks would be insufficient.

Kamala calls herself a capitalist for a reason.  GOP has long tried to say that Dems are socialists. This is a lie!!!  The economic system that is best in providing opportunities for all combines REGULATED capitalism along with social programs that help those in need.  The GOP since Reagan has stripped the regs involving banking, business, investment, housing industry, oil industry etc.  Many of these regs were instituted by FDR.  Deregulation, cutting the taxes of the richest, providing them with big loopholes, and using trickle down theory all led to the enormous gap in income.  

Harris wants healthcare for all.  How that actually ends up happening doesn’t matter.

Black people could go everywhere white people could go, even your kids schools! Women could control their own fertility with the birth control pill and they could get their own credit cards–without their husbands! When there is social progress there is always, always a backlash. 

The backlash here is the modern Republican party. From Reagan forward they have been against any policy that might materially benefit average Americans (because now it included *them*). The NRA went from a gun safety outfit to a crazed gun rights lobbying group. Gotta keep a lot of guns around in case the government betrays us again. And American evangelicals suddenly developed strong feelings about abortion. Prior to this it was just the Catholics, a minority that the rest of the country could easily ignore. 

A few decades go by. Then suddenly there's a black family in the white house for eight years. Democrats were certain to put a woman in next, plus gays can get married now!

Along comes Donald Jerome Trump. His open racism and misogyny signaled to a lot of white Americans that here was someone who would finally fight back and preserve their precious way of life (where women and people of color knew their places). That is in fact what MAGA means.

Which of Trump's actions made you come to the conclusion that there is a racist problem, especially in politics, in the U.S.?

Personally, I was never fooled by BLM movement. Did I post a black square on Instagram like a sheep following the herd? Definitely not. People who get harsh treatment from police officers are those who harshly break the law. People of hip hop culture, regardless of skin tone, are generally the most nefarious of us, and most dangerous and tricky to deal with. It is a problem of culture, not race. I tell people this all the time: hip hop culture is a pollutant which infects the stream of good music and people. Criminals are often killed by police officers. It's just the ones that happen to black are the ones you hear of, because of the mental illness of wokeism.

It probably has the most gerrymandering in the country; both houses of the state legislature are 80% or higher despite the fact that Republican Presidential candidates regularly get over 30% of the vote and every now and then they elect a moderate Republican governor.

Massachusetts has some of the best colleges and universities in the country as well as some of the best hospitals as well.

Massachusetts has the lowest violent crime rates in the country for a state with a large urban mixed race population. True, Maine, NH and Vermont have lower violent crimes rates, but those states have few urban areas and lower population densities.

Massachusetts has huge negatives from my point of view; very restrictive gun laws (that means your right of self defense is restricted), extremely high rents and housing costs, and soul destroying traffic jams. However, these negatives reflect the fact that Massachusetts has an abundance of high paying jobs and career opportunities.

Why do people keep voting for Democrats in Massachusetts? Why mess with success? And I say this a someone leaning towards Trump.

I should also add that unlike NY and RI, Democrats in Massachusetts have managed to avoid electing stupid or corrupt politicians.

We already saw that in the 2020 election with Georgia, as Atlanta and more densely populated counties turned the state into a swing state...Texas had a blue wave as well and there was a chance of Texas going blue in the 2020 election. In the end obviously they didn't. But as more and more dems flock to larger cities and the newest generation of voters likely being democrats, once the city populas is enough to overpower the rural populas, and the baby boomers start to thin out these previously red states will begin to turn blue.

ChatGPT doesn't know ""the sky is blue"" -- it knows ""90% of training texts with 'the sky' included the words 'is blue' after, but 5% of training texts said 'is purple', so it outputs ""the sky is purple"" to the question ""what color is the sky"" every 20th time you ask it (this is not a literal example, I don't know how many times you have to ask it what color the sky is to get a confidently wrong answer from it these days).

If you trained it on a message board of science fiction writers, it might see 'the sky is purple' 25% of the time and 'the sky is green' 25% of the time. You'll then start getting ""the sky is purple"" or ""green"" when you ask it that question around 50% of the time.

Of course you do, because that’s what you want to hear. And, of course, you’ll accuse me of the same.

>The pause in between, the fact that “his supporter’s his demonization” makes no sense

Biden has a stutter. He’s talked for years about conquering it. But clearly he’s not capable of controlling it anymore.

A stutter is basically getting stuck while you’re speaking. Either difficulty getting a word out or repeating the same word over again.

The “his-his-his” makes it obvious he’s in the middle of a stutter between “supporter’s” and “demonization”. He got stuck after “supporter’s” and is essentially trying to restart. Rephrasing is a strategy for people with a stutter to get around words they’re stuck on. Biden is stuck on “supporter’s demonization” and switching to “his demonization” to get around it, but he still trips over “his” multiple times before he can continue.

If Biden was focused on Trump’s supporters being garbage, I’d expect to hear a lot more “they’re” in the follow up comments. The fact he immediately follows “supporter’s/supporters” with “his [singular] demonization” tells me Biden’s focus and intent are on the comments made by the comedian and not Trump’s supporters as a whole.

These same men have all but claimed that they ought to be a protected class.

But this isn't anything new. It's been going on for decades.

And look, I can concede that some men in this country have been feeling increasingly isolated, and have their own societal wide issues to contend with.

HOWEVER, for years, these men have been trying desperately to scapegoat women and women's rights movements, democrats, liberal social policies and the addressing of injustices.

There's, ironically of course, no responsibility in this. Because the hard truth is, what some of these men are feeling, is a result of a well-oiled, long standing patriarchal society pressuring them with and imposing certain expectations on them.

So this movement emerges around what is now called, the ""manosphere"", where some men start gravitating towards right wing voices and personalities like Jordan Peterson, and an extreme cases, people like Andrew Tate. 

As a result, these movements and public figures, whether they want to acknowledge it or not, end up encouraging or perpetuating harmful stereotypes, misogyny, harassment and abuse, radicalization, what some might call ""toxic masculinity,"" the undermining of gender equality and discrimination towards the LGBTQ community. While there are also links between some members of this movement and acts of violence. 

It is not a *""crisis of masculinity""* as much as it is a crisis of insecurity.

So what this all boils down to is the recognition that figures like Trump, who, conflictingly, represent the aggressive, ""alpha male"" archetype,  the strongman persona, the old school authority figure, while being a symbol of masculinity, naturally draw these men in.

But the irony of it all, is that Trump represents what they really are, because Trump is an incredibly insecure, shallow and fragile person. He's also a serial adulterer, misogynist, sexist, sexual abuser, innate child, and a WORLD class victim.

And all of these things, especially Trump's persecution complex, appeals to these men. 

What makes it worse, is that in the eyes of these same men, Kamala Harris represents that scapegoat. She is everything they despise. She is the symbol for their resentment and their grievances.

So demagogues *like* Donald Trump, JD Vance, even Elon Musk, play into this, and it's a fairly effective strategy. 

They can get away with blaming women, especially liberal women, Democrats, even Harris herself, for oppressing these aggrieved men, for dismantling traditional/regressive gender roles and family structures, for transforming society for the worse, for destroying ""the nuclear family,"" for *forcing* women to be more independent, for taking away men's privilege to be kings of their own domain, the authoritative, household breadwinner and dictator of the home and the workplace.

Sometimes it's even a matter of not having the privilege anymore to be abusive, or sexually harass coworkers, cheat on their spouses without consequence, or even having to be relegated to household chores duty, which is obviously so beneath them, but these are things they probably won't say out loud...

That being said, at the end of the day, what these men don't realize, is that their blame is misdirected. Again, maybe they should start with reflecting on how we got here. Maybe they should be thinking about how literally centuries of rigid, dogmatic, inequitable social structures and gender norms caused a lot of problems to begin with. 

After that, they should probably start directing that reflection inward, and realize that ""masculinity"" isn't defined by how tan your balls are, or how much testosterone you're injecting, or how confrontational and aggressive you can be, or how insecure you are about not living up to your own expectations that have been instilled in you by a broken and imposing patriarchal system.",2024-10-27 02:48:58,39,politics,True,1

But it does make me wonder for what the broader MAGA movement does post-Trump. In the immediate aftermath of Hitler's death they seemed to go one of two ways. You had the power-hungry arseholes who more than anything tried to keep power. These ones in some sort of narcissistic delusion thought that the occupying forces would just let them keep running the show as if they'd done nothing wrong. I reckon most of the politicians that went all in on Trump will go down this route - try to keep going while pretending they didn't have a decade-long mental break.

What's more concerning were the true believers, especially those in the general populace. In the wake of Hitler's death, there was a shocking number of suicides as people who were so completely brainwashed saw their world collapsing around them. When MAGA has essentially gone the Goebbels route of building up this world of ""evil Democrats"" and all these other enemies with Trump being the only one who can save them all, a collapsing MAGA world without Trump presents a disturbing possibility.

https://thehill.com/opinion/4560169-this-is-not-james-carvilles-1992-democratic-party/

>the Democratic Party is the women’s party. Sixty percent of self-identified Democrats are women. The base of the Democratic Party, its most loyal voters, are women of color. Ninety-two percent of Black women, 65 percent of Latinas and 69 percent of AAPI women voted for Joe Biden in 2020. 

>Carville says Democrats should be talking about beer, hamburgers and football. That may have been good advice in 1992. This week’s Democratic victory in a special election in Alabama, where Democrat Marilyn Lands decisively flipped a Republican seat by running on abortion rights and IVF, suggests otherwise.

>Today’s Democrats are talking about what motivates their voters, and a majority of Americans: that Republicans in 2024 are trying to take away decades of progress for women.

If Democrat voters don't vote they are effectively voting for a genocidal, felonious maniac who has primed the supreme court to allow him to be immune from any form of prosecution for any of his actions while president. He has already promised that they (the left side of the democrats) will be killed by the military. You can't influence future administrations if you are dead.

Democrats outdonated Republicans by a factor of two this election and Harris has no use for pandering to far right Jewish interests. If the democrats lose, it will because of voter suppression.

Conservative media leaves out the negative stuff about Trump to present a dishonest image of him, but that's not all they're doing. They're also training their target audience to distrust that overwhelming evidence of Trump's corruption, dishonesty, racism, incompetence, etc., even though they've seen and heard it for themselves. 

Getting their audience to believe that their own eyes and ears can't be trusted sounds like gaslighting to me. Gaslighting them into believing that Harris completely bombed an interview that actually had Trump whining about having to face Harris rather than Biden is just one tiny piece of it. 

The reason that there's such a deep political divide in our country, far worse than anything before the ""tea party,"" is that the two sides used to broadly agree on the basic facts but disagree about principles and priorities. 

But MAGAs don't agree on the basic facts. They've been convinced that the things they can see and hear with their own eyes are not to be trusted, that it's all being manipulated to create a false impression. If something is in the mainstream media, and conservative media are telling a different story, they're conditioned to reject anything that comes from the mainstream media as untrustworthy *even when they can confirm it for themselves* without trusting the mainstream media.

lrk98s1,"Donald Trump’s speech to Detroit business leaders Thursday night contained a truly bewildering riff about “Biden circles” and their beauty.

The former president has made headlines over the course of his campaign with strange speeches about whether it’s better to be electrocuted or attacked by a shark and giving unintelligible, rambling answers to policy questions. Trump has defended his free-wheeling, sometimes unfollowable oratory style as a deliberate ploy he calls “the weave”—but his latest effort looked more like unraveling.

During Trump’s speech at the Detroit Economic Club—which included a segment insulting the city of Detroit, prompting condemnation from the mayor—the Republican nominee was speaking about how American manufacturing can be affected by other countries’ tariffs before veering off-topic into a discussion about Elon Musk, rockets, and, for some reason, circles.  “It’s very sad to see and it’s so simple,” he said, continuing:

""I mean, you know, this isn’t like Elon with his rocket ships that land within 12 inches on the moon where they wanted to land. Or he gets the engines back, that was the first I realized—I said: ‘Who the hell did that?’ I saw engines about three, four years ago.

Trump appears to be referring to circles on the ground used as a social-distancing measure at President Joe Biden’s campaign events four years ago during the COVID pandemic. Trump was seemingly reminded of them by SpaceX’s reusable rocket boosters because they land on circular targets painted on drone ships. What any of that has to do with tariffs is anyone’s guess.

The circle ramble wasn’t his only bizarre aside during the speech.

When you take away the layers of rambling, it's honestly pathetic how much mental energy Trump spends on convincing himself he's not a loser. He genuinely thinks people following safety protocol during a once-in-a-century pandemic was a coverup for Biden not being popular. He saw the election not as the country deciding who would best be fit to run it, but as the ultimate popularity contest. What he doesn't get is that you can vote for a politician without being so devoted to them that you have to watch them speak in person.

Harris was right when she said Trump was having a tough time processing that he lost.

To help clarify just how much of an uphill battle Harris faces and why she needs everyone's unwavering support no matter what the polls and media spin = the shortest winning presidential campaign was 357 days or  11 months, 22 days from announcing to GE by Ronald Reagan. 

So give Harris credit & grace while staying the course.

And there were rumors of some back and forth between them. In fact, there was a public address where Obama joked about Biden's arrogance. It was a joke-but I remember thinking-there was some battle of wills there. Kamala is not a child. Politics is not a children's game-I'm sure there were ego battles and some such other crap between Kamala and Biden, maybe even disagreements and who knows-they privately may even dislike each other. Any adult who has ever had a boss and works a difficult job knows the relationship can often be frayed and is not indicative of the performance of either boss or employee.

Cough Pence Cough. But since they are not children and running the country is not a children's game, they have publically supported each other. Need anyone be reminded, much of Trump's administration officials have publicaly and vocally chided him and/or supported Biden and/or supported Harris and/or opposed his election. So there's that for how little any of this means. As long as Biden hasn't publically called Kamala shit or incompetent, this stupid gossip mongering and reading into every minute action of Biden is so dumb.

P.S. Biden may ""hate"" Kamala but there is only one partner in crime who is expressing his criticism publically-and that just happens to be Pence.

Because the fund they had raised was to the Biden/Harris ticket, so if they ousted Biden, they would have to stick to Harris, or the RNC would sue them. it’s reported that RNC was ready to file a lawsuit if they promoted another candidate but continue to use the same fund raised for the Biden/Harris ticket. So at that time, the DNC basically was juggling between allowing Biden to stay or risking running Harris. They knew that Kamala wasn’t ready, or Biden wouldn’t have to run for another term. Then they got Kamala Tim Walz (trust me, I’m sure Kamala didn’t have a say), who isn’t that popular and who’s also quite extreme. At that point I felt that the Dem Party just wanted to experiment how many American people would vote for them if they ran a ticket like this, and on the other hand, to save the reputation of more promising candidates such as Josh Shapiro for 2028.

So 2028 it’ll be a tough year for us.

At best your argument is with the law that allows it, which is a legislative not executive issue. So there is absolutely zero valid basis for your attack on Trump here.

Just because you are living under a rock doesn't mean we all are. I wonder, at what point does it not become hysteria to you? When you are actually on your way to a camp? Go over and take a look at what gets upvoted on mainstream reddit. Just a week ago I watched them laugh and cheer as a 70 year old gold star mom was sentenced to spend the rest of her life in prison for doing what she thought was her civil duty under the law - even according to their own twisted account of events she was a non-violent first time offender with no articulable victim or harm that resulted. We can even show examples of their own political allies doing the same thing (but in a way that actually violates the law and did cause real harm) yet they don't care. It is plainly obvious they don't care about the principles of law or any factual matter of guilt or innocence in these cases, rather they are just excuses to hold witch trials and perform a modern day lynching. This isn't just on reddit this is the actual mainstream sentiment of most democrats. You can read the judges opinions and listen to them on video - their speech is filled with hate and vitriol for us because of who we are not because of any particular thing that we did.

This is behavior that demonstrates a level of conditioning among the population that is very much in line with what we saw in the lead up to nazi germany, the cultural revolution in China, and many other such events throughout history.

He didn't say that. Now you are just lying. Post the clip. I saw what CNN did they took one clip where he was talking about the ""enemy within"" and then they cut and spliced it with his comments about the military which was in a different context. Do you disagree that we have an enemy within? The democrats say Trump is an enemy within, they say him and his people are a threat to the country. So what is your point here exactly other than to spread this democrat propaganda narrative that isn't based in reality?

> While Harris will undoubtedly be bad for the country, it's extremely unlikely that she'll start rounding up Trump supporters and putting them in camps.

Ok and I disagree with you. Maybe you feel safe because you aren't that involved in politics. Those who are more overtly involved in politics are definitely at risk if those guilty of spearheading their political persecution so far have those actions validated and supported by the population on election day. You should read up on the cultural revolution and how it happened because you seem completely oblivious to it and in denial.

Like, should I hate my parents because they were raised as traditional Mexican Catholics and are thus conservative? (I do think I've convinced them to vote for Kamala, even though they heavily dislike her).

I'm not at all qualified to give advice (heck, I can't even vote thanks to my age), but if you want to get your wife to not vote Trump I'd say hammer home Trump's association to Project 2025. He's recently been denying any connection, but he had some of the people behind it on his cabinet last year. Additionally, they have 100% guaranteed spots on his hypothetical cabinet, the Heritage Foundation (think tank behind Project 2025) supports Republicans, Trump himself and JD Vance has praised the project and the Heritage Foundation, and some right-wingers are mad at Trump trying to distance himself from it.

So, what is Project 2025? It's the far right's plan to transform the US into a Christian dictatorship, only allowing the 'perfect' white, heterosexual nuclear family as citizens. Note only one sect of Christianity will come out on top, others (like mine, Catholicism) will likely be stamped out. For proof, look at the Pilgrims' reason for fleeing Europe, the Salem Witch Trials, and the reason Rhode Island was established in the first place. It means the end of the freedoms that make America, America as we know, never mind destroying democracy. Basically, all the Amendments will go bye-bye, along with most of the Constitution.

If you want more reasons, show her clips of Nazis at Trump's rally. His 'concepts of an idea' bit from the debate regarding a plan around (I think) healthcare. The times he's called the city he's campaigning in trash. His 'I don't care about you, I just want your vote' bit he told supporters at a rally. How he won't release medical records over being shot (it looks like a piece of glass chipped him, not the bullet). Hiding behind a pixeglass barrier from assassins while preaching gun freedom. His 'grab them by the pussy' comment. His looking at underage teenagers at a show he owns because he can. Him being found guilty of rape. Telling people to inject bleach into their veins to combat Covid. His somehow bankrupting casinos as proof of his economic prowess. If you want more examples, just ask.

But but but but but, if all you want to do is live with your wife who you obviously love, then ask her to not bring up politics. Ask your family to do the same. Without the rift politics can cause, I think you'll get along just fine. It might sting knowing you're voting for opposite sides, so your votes cancel out, but other than that no politics is a fairly happy way to live.

lrth265,"I'm not saying you have no reason to be concerned, but just keep in mind:

1. The movement in polls is so slight, it's just as likely to be statistical noise as actual changes in opinion.

2. There are enough polls circulating right now that you could support virtually any narrative you wanted. And the overwhelming narrative right now is that Harris is faltering (just like a month ago it was Harris was crushing it, and the month before that it was Harris was experiencing a brief honeymoon that would vanish, and the month before that it was Trump was a deadlock for the election, and the month before that is was Biden was behind but prepping for a post-debate bounce).

3. Harris is running behind Biden with the groups you mentioned, and yet she's still tied or leading Trump. How is that possible? Because she's gained with other groups over Biden, such as educated white voters, seniors and women. But when was the last time you saw a headline like, ""Trump bleeding support among the educated and seniors""? Again, you can selectively use data to craft basically any narrative you want.

4. Polls are a helpful tool for campaigns to determine whether their message is effective and where to allocate resources. As a tool for predicting future outcomes along the margins, they are fairly worthless. If polling in early-to-mid October was spot on, Gore, Kerry, Romney and Clinton would have won, and Biden's election would have been a blowout.

Stop colonizing them, stop genociding them, and give them back their agency and sovereignty. Sending bombs is not going to prevent future acts of terrorism, contrarily it will only make more terrorists.

Exactly, nothing that Israel is doing is gonna even solve anything for them or make them safer. It's just vengeance for the sake of vengeance (because of a situation they created ofc).

Kamala is overall to the right of myself. Not a deal breaker in itself but certainly made this next part easier. I cannot describe what is happening in Gaza as anything other than a genocide.

The Biden admin has had many furrowed brows and “tense conversations” and that seems to make Bibi mad but it hasn’t changed that we have given them every weapon they have asked for and then some (we sent in air craft carriers to break a blockade). 

As someone whose actual stance is something close to stop all arms immediately, compromise would be something like conditional arms sales, under conditions of a one state solution with equal rights for Palestine and Jews. Instead, I’m told that “compromise” is unconditional, unlimited arms sales but with a frowny face and yeah that’s not good enough in the face of genocide.

[An Eight-point Brief On Lesser Evil Voting](https://chomsky.info/an-eight-point-brief-for-lev-lesser-evil-voting/)

>Another point of disagreement involves the ethical/moral principle sometimes referred to as the “politics of moral witness.” Generally associated with the religious left, secular leftists implicitly invoke it when they reject LEV on the grounds that “a lesser of two evils is still evil.” Leaving aside the obvious rejoinder that **this is exactly the point of lesser evil voting-i.e. to do less evil**, what needs to be challenged is the assumption that voting should be seen as a form of individual self-expression rather than as an act to be judged on its likely consequences. The basic moral principle at stake is simple: **not only must we take responsibility for our actions, but the consequences of our actions for others are a far more important consideration than feeling good about ourselves.**

The genocide is NOT okay and I don't like that Biden has supported it with funding, but I do believe at least with Kamala that there will be more of a chance to get things resolved sooner and end the devastation that has happened. With Trump? There is NO chance.

She's trying to win the election. Your problem isn't that she's ignoring ""voters"", your problem is that she's trying to win an election by listening to a bigger block of voters than the block of voters you represent

I think that's partially true, but it's missing a price of the puzzle. I might be naive about this but I genuinely believe that, at least on the left, there are more people against the genocide (let's call them group A) than there are for it (group B). The real problem is that out of that group A, a large majority of them are ready to compromise out of fear of the insanity that comes with Trump. The remaining folks from group A feel horrified by that compromise, we can call them group C. 

Group C is smaller than group B. Every person willing to compromise in group A gives power to group B. This is sadly one of the downsides to being reasonable people, you unintentionally give a green light to the people who rely on you to ignore you and focus on the people who are unreasonable. 

>Someday, hopefully, the number of voters who care about Palestinians will approach the number of pro-genocide voters - and at that point a presidential candidate trying to win elections will change their stance.  

If nobody remains in group C, it doesn't matter how many people are in A. There have to be people willing to put their foot down for it to actually make a difference. 

> The solution to that is to advocate for your position, change minds, answer polls, and vote in primaries. 

I agree. Let's be honest though, the primaries didn't matter this election. We glossed over it because too much was at stake to rock the boat, so much so that we ignored any signs that Biden might not be the ideal choice until his debate with Trump. At least we did something about that, but the liberals are still playing conservatively, when they are supposed be the party of change.

ltwdnru,"I do think Donald Trump has a better shot at winning this election, but I wouldn't be surprised if Harris wins against betting odds.

Betting usually happens in the background, but this year, Donald Trump and his running mate Elon Musk have frequently advertised their numbers online, this has caused the number of right-wing bettors that consume ""red-wave"" sources on those platforms to soar. When Trump's betting odds soared in mid-October, nothing fundamentally changed from the beginning of the month, except, well, Elon Musk promoting the platform when Trump took the slightest lead. The next day, Trump's odds soared to 60%, and that was no coincidence. The wisdom of the crowd loses functionality if most of the bettors are all coming straight out of a MAGA rally. 

But why don't Kamala Harris supporters join in to make lots of money? I am sure they are, but I wouldn't be surprised if some are nervous. No candidate has won the election when their opponent leads by 20% in the betting markets in October. There are a lot of hard-core bettors who are inclined to bet against that, but is your average gambling Joe going to? It might be becoming a sort of bubble, where people bet Trump *because* he is leading by so much on these platforms. Ultimately, the idea Trump could win is based on a handful of core assumptions that may be proven fallible on election night, but we'll see.

1. The current betting pool for the election is well over $2B, so a single $10m bet is not going to make a big difference. 

2. Betting on a candidate is not akin to any kind of market manipulation - what market are you trying to influence?

3. Betting on elections is a uniquely singular process, different from sports betting in a primary fashion - bettors have an opportunity to directly impact the outcome when THEY cast their vote. The same can’t be said for people who bet on, say, an NBA game. 

4. The oddsmakers have a direct incentive to predict the outcome correctly. They need to balance the flow of money and/or have the favorite win so they don’t end up massively in the hole when it comes time to pay everyone. 

In the example that has been given multiple times about large $10m bets coming in for Trump, if that was enough to move the needle, they would offset that action by dramatically improving the odds for Kamala so they could draw money back to the opposing stance. The net impact of this is how you get the “line” - and it corrects quickly, based on money flow.

This is why the market doesn't reflect the reality of the race. The race 1 person votes cancelation out another's, it doesn't take 1.5 million voters to cancel out 1 persons vote like this betting market requires. Either that or you need 1 person to bet 30 million in kamala favor. Which is why the market isn't a reflection on the election, it's a reflection for what rich people want the election results to be.

I'm not shitting on people who bet in it or saying you have to be rich to bet in it. I'm saying rich people can sway it. The fact that musk can bet 100mil tomorrow and skew the odds 5% makes this whole thing inaccurate and is just dependent on an equal number of gamblers on both sides with an equal number of resources both betting at the same volume. The fact is, volume is a measurement that doesn't apply in terms of individual voters.

Maybe this will help.

In an election the only factor that matters is the number of voters. 

If team As # of  voters > team Bs number of voters, team A wins. If not, team b wins. Simple, only 1 factor matters and that is voter numbers

On the betting markets there are 2 factors to determine the odds, 1 is # of betters and the other is the size of the bet 

If team As # of betters > team Bs number of betters, the odds can show that team B is winning because of the factor of  bet size being greater. 

Thus factor throws off the market by accounting for the size of bets, when an election the only thing that matters is the number of voters. It doesn't matter how enthusiastic a single voter is, or how much money they have, every vote is worth 1, every bet is not worth 1, therefore 1 really enthusiastic better betting 10 skews the data.",2024-10-26 05:11:41,2,PoliticalDiscussion,True,1

You also now have an unknown hand weighing things out which is another thing that skews the results because now it isn't even reflective of what betters want or how confident betters are on their candidate, now it is just about what 1 company needs the odds to be to stay in business. 

It doesn't have to reflect the actual likelihood of a candidate winning, it only has to reflect the amount of money put in - their profit margin. 

I'm sorry, we have gone through the math and now you are saying the house has supernatural knowledge of how voters will really vote (not based on polls) and will be able to manipulate the betting market to reflect reality regardless of money put into the market. You understand how everything you're arguing leads to less accuracy in the market right? Like you're now adding more factors that don't exist in an election. Because now the market isn't just about the number of betters, which BTW is the only factor in an election is the number of voters. Now you've added weighted voting where some voters hold more valuable votes, but now you have introduced a deep state element that will change the tallies to reflect the reality they believe will happen. And are claiming the the voters being weighted and the hand of the deep state are gonna be more accurate than polls that only factor in the number of voters. 

There are too many external factors in betting markets for them to be accurate in an election. Thats just the reality. Doesn't mean you can't bet on them or like them. But they are too easily manipulated to look at them and say they are the most accurate.

So the question becomes, why are people like trump and musk telling you that the most manipulatable ""poll"" is the most accurate. The answer is simple. They want you to believe in those markets so if they lose they can point and say ""no, polymarket said we were up 20% there's no way we lost read claim the election was rigged.

Lincoln defended his actions as justified in times of rebellion or invasion, when public safety was at stake. He later sought retroactive authorization from Congress, which granted it, effectively legalizing his emergency measures.

Lincoln’s actions highlight an important tension between the branches of government, particularly during emergencies. While in extreme circumstances, the executive might take actions that challenge judicial authority, these actions are highly controversial and often provoke constitutional debate. They are usually justified under extraordinary circumstances, like war or national crises, but they also raise concerns about the erosion of the rule of law and separation of powers.

When Republicans seized the house, Gingrich used the powers of the speaker - things like committee appointments, office allocations, etc. - to ensure Republicans voted in line, thereby ensuring Clinton needed Republican votes to move legislation. 

During Bush's term Pelosi used the same technique but escalated it, even on bipartisan legislation which was favorable to Democrats. The strategy worked better for Democrats at the time because they were more likely to hold the house than the presidency, so decreasing a Republican president's effectiveness was seen as a means of electing a Democrat.

This has become the norm and both parties are more likely to vote along party lines in the Senate and house.

If you look at 538 aggregate polling today, Trump has 219 electoral and Kamala has 223 based on all the non-tossup states.

Check the rest of the polls as of today:

State	|	Trump	|	Harris
---	|	---	|	---
Arizona	|	48.7	|	46.7
Georgia	|	48.8	|	46.9
Michigan	|	47.1	|	47.7
Nevada	|	47.1	|	47.7
North Carolina	|	48.2	|	47.4
Pennsylvania	|	47.7	|	47.9
Wisconsin	|	47.7	|	47.8

It's basically a statistical tie at this point.

Now, for fun, if you assume each state has a 50/50 chance for each candidate to win, there are 128 scenarios of Kamala/Trump winning. Of those scenarios, Kamala gets to 270 in 64 scenarios, Trump gets there in 54 scenarios, and it goes to Congress in 10 scenarios.

Here are the scenarios where the election gets decided by Congress:

Harris has a lot of grass roots support from people that didn’t vote for Biden (this is shown in the amount of new voter donations she received when she announced her candidacy). Secondly, the recent “surge” Trump has seen is nothing more than right wing pollsters having reported their results in higher quantity than left wing pollsters In recent weeks.  As you said, Trump hasn’t really done anything to get a surge in the polls. 
Pollsters are a money making business and they have been wrong in understating Trumps support in 2016 and 2020. I doubt they want to be wrong about him again.  Which is another reason why I think their methodology is favoring Trump",2024-10-18 23:34:18,4,PoliticalDiscussion,True,1

It’s hard to believe Trump does *better* after RvW and Jan 6th but hard to believe doesn’t mean impossible.  

I think in the end we just have to wait for the real poll that happens Nov 5. My expectations are Trump being a 3 time pop vote loser while winning the EC again to a pretty comfortable Harris victory. I’ll end up surprised if Trump wins the popular vote after losing to the prior two times.

She has really dropped the ball on taking too long to do interviews, and then when doing interviews on friendly shows (like The View and Colbert) she can't differentiate herself from Biden. I was shocked that she was not prepared for this question.

Harris was right when she said that she is the underdog. Considering her past performance in the 2020 primaries (her campaign ended before voting in Iowa started) people should have seen this coming. Also, she ran to the left of Bernie Sanders at that time which makes explaining her newly moderate positions during this election pretty tricky. She simply is not politically saavy enough to explain her policy shifts, or how the next 4 years will be different than the last 4 years, beyond dodging questions and resorting to political talking points.

Harris needs to get off her script and humanize herself to the public. The Al Smith charity dinner last night was the perfect opportunity for her to do that and instead she sent a cringey video to play. Even the comedian Jim Gaffigan called her out on not showing up saying the event was a ""lay up"" for her, especially considering its NYC and just about everyone in the room hates Trump!

 Also a big reason she's disliked is on the rare occasions that she does interview she just avoids answering every single question asked to her in every interview and then goes on for 75 to 80% of the interview about Donald Trump. If she's so qualified she needs to stop making the vast minority of her campaign about trump. I mean her Intire campaign is the idea that she's a prosicutor and she's gonna get trump.

TV now shows more than just white people, even though it still is predominantly white saturated, it cannot omit people who are non white as it did up until the 1960's, and since the 1970's more and more people of color are in the media.

Society can no longer try to stand against black music as they did in the pre-1970's, because today's musician mix it up with all races and ethnicities and they fuse their music with flavors from all races.

*When it comes to inter-racial kids, people are having them by ""choice"" with whom they Love*, not like the long history before when inter-racial kids were the product of white men raping black women.

It' no longer a society where white people own all the material things, today, anything in the market place is being bought by people of all races and ethnicities.

When it comes to sports, there's only a few sports that are predominantly white, not like the pre-1940's when white people did not want to play and compete fairly with black people.

White people can't stop non white people from buying homes where ever they want to buy it.   White people can't keep black people out of Public Parks and Public Pools, like they did in the past.  White people can't make or expect black people to get off the sidewalk as they could and did in the past.

People can't stop their son's and daughters from choosing whom ever they want to choose as mate.   and white people can't force their version of religion down the throats of other white people like they could in the past and they can't force it upon non white people, as they could in the past.

All the anguish that Trump supporters have and promote toward the young people because many of them make more money than these older generation did when they were young and  young people make more money than some of them even now in  their older age. Young people don't have to do the manual labor the older generation did, *will not be recreated. because technology and know how, has innovated society within tools that help get labor performed.* 

*Young people are nor restricted to the Old Books that promoted a white nationalist narrative of history and society, they now by the use of technology can research and learn historical truth, and learn that white man was not the hero in every story, and that white men alone did not create everything.* 

*Young people are not ""inhibited and self repressed about their sexuality and their thoughts and things they do, will not return to a time of censorship and religious repression and social stigma repressiveness.*",2024-10-18 23:34:18,6,PoliticalDiscussion,True,1

Low information voters are voters without a guiding ideology. They are the ones that swing elections. They will vote based on things like the economy or the charisma of the politicians. They do not care about the ideology of the parties, they care about what they perceive will benefit them in the short to medium term. 

For this reason, Kamala is being tainted by Biden and the perception of the economy.

Democrats are generally in denial of this.  When they lose, they blame others instead of fault themselves for ignoring political reality.  They like to think that they can run on their policy wonking, when few voters care about such things.

So they won't learn anything.  If lessons had been learned from John Kerry, Al Gore, Mike Dukakis and Walter Mondale, then they would not have pushed the anti-charismatic Hillary Clinton to the forefront because they would have known that style matters.

Kamala Harris is not exactly anti-charismatic as was Hillary, but she is far from an ideal choice.

Frankly the election season is as along as it is because of states like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.  If states or specifically congress set a date requiring primaries to be held on lets say The second Tuesday in September.  That would limit the amount of money being spent on TV.   It would drastically reduce spending primary candidates would need to have since it would give time for a more thorough local campaigning season followed by an abridged general election.  With modern tech as it is there is plenty of time from the Middle of September to November to get ballots out for voters.  You can't limit campaign spending really with this version of the supreme court but you can limit how long the season lasts.

This political geography has also dictated a strategy that seems to prioritize white voters. Harris’ campaign is angling to capture as many suburban voters as possible, in part by appealing to former Republicans and Trump-loathing moderates. It is taking advantage of a shift away from the GOP among college-educated voters, who are mostly white, to make up for losses among racial minorities. Harris’ appearances with Liz Cheney; her much-touted endorsements from other Republicans; her reassurances to moderates and pivots toward the center: These tactics are all aimed at the white-skewing, higher-educated Americans who may well decide the election.",2024-10-15 16:41:58,13,PoliticalDiscussion,True,1

ls4sf2b,"Because something like half a million people hold the key to deciding whether or not we go full fascism or stave it off a little longer.

I don't know if I'd say she's shifted right on things like healthcare or even gun reform.

On the former: expanding Medicare to include live-in care is monumental and something no one else has brought up. Hospice care, even at home, is incredibly expensive. Most boomers are in their 60s and 70s. The average life span in the U.S. is about 77.5 years, according to the CDC. So they're getting to that ""average"" age about now or getting close to it.

On the latter: This is just me being a little pedantic, but dropping the weapons buy back program isn't necessarily the same as moving right. She's still advocating for closing loopholes and expanding background checks -- what she calls ""common sense"" gun reform. The GOP calls that government overreach, but they scream that about anything that they dislike for one reason or another.

Her position on fracking hasn't changed since 2016. It's literally one thing she's been vocally consistent about because she doesn't feel like it's a big enough deal to make a federal case about it.

The border has and always will be contentious because the majority of Americans don't understand how our southern border or how sanctuary or even legal immigration works. Immigrants have long been a boogeyman for whichever party wants to make it an issue (nevermind that 65% of Americans live within the 100-mile ""border zone"" per Bloomberg). To answer your question, though: she's said several times that Congress had a tough bipartisan border bill that Trump personally killed. So I think her platform is really playing off that.

She's been campaigning heavily in the swing states and hitting the rust belt hard. The so-called blue-collar workers hold the key to fascism or democracy and for some reason care a lot about the southern border (apparently). I know that losing manufacturing jobs is a big concern of theirs as well as gun rights. They fear that restrictions infringe on their 2nd amendment right to bear arms, which will impact their cultural way of life when it comes to hunting (literally, hunting is the only thing I've ever seen gun owners express any actual concern about. There has been SOME stuff about personal security, but hunting is really what people want their guns for.) 

Basically: I think she's trying to have her cake and eat it, too. And I really hope it works out because the electoral college is stupid and single issue voters who are pretending they can actually impact the 2 party system are delusional.",2024-10-15 16:41:58,5,PoliticalDiscussion,True,1

Whether they loved or hated him, people felt strongly about Trump. But turnout in 2020 was not historic due to voters  being super excited about Biden and his platform.

* Biden won, but it was very close in the decisive states and he underperformed his polls hugely. Against the backdrop of the worst public health crisis in a century which the incumbent had fumbled badly, plus the worst racial protests in 30 years which supercharged black turnout, Biden's performance in 2020 really wasn't anything special.

ls5g5uo,"My view point:
Both candidates have shifted more center. Statistically most people are moderate. They may be more left on some issues and more right on others, for the most part people aren't extreme. 
Given that, each party has to kind of adapt and be less extreme while trying to hold on to the classical values of their party so they can keep their current voters and try to get independents/undecided. 
Trump hasn't changed a whole lot, he's less intense about a few things and very firm on others. 
Harris, as said by someone else (🐦) is being pragmatic and I'm sure her team knows that her very, very progressive views in 19/20 did her a huge disservice and as the campaign progresses, she's realizing that to appeal to center people, she needs to be more center and that some of Trump's/Republican policies/ideas are appealing to both sides of voters so to compensate for her previous progressive views, she's shifting center/right on some things. 
And honestly, no one I knew that voted for Biden voted because they liked him. They voted bc he wasn't Trump (myself included). Biden was peculiar at best, with some okay ideas but mostly fluff that wouldn't happen (student debt relief) and ""I'm not trump!"" And Harris, no one liked back then. Again, this is anecdotal but none of us liked her at all, and continued to not like her through the admin. 
Her starting her campaign as ""not trump"" and fluff ideas wasn't working, her policies being different in person vs her teams statements didn't work, progressive ideals didn't really work, so now she's centering more and adapting some moderate conservative ideals in the name of gaining votes. 
Which, personally, I can't stand. I love someone adapting based on what the voters want but within reason, changing her position either in speech or in statement every time I watch or read anything on her is just shining an inconsistent ""I'll say anything to get votes"" light on her, reflecting the constant ""idek who she is now"" rhetoric I see going around. ",2024-10-15 16:41:58,-1,PoliticalDiscussion,True,0

lrc54ks,"No. The average percent of votes in the past 8 election cycles are as follows: Democrat 49.05 ; Republican 45.31 ; Independent: 5.14. Additionally in the past 8 election cycles Democrats won 62.5% of the time and Republicans won 37.5% of the time. If you want for elections to be the most fair over a period of multiple elections then you want each party to be in office for roughly the same percent of time as correlated to the percent of votes they got

If we elongate 8 cycles to 100 cycles then Democrats should be in office for \~49 cycles, Republicans' \~45 cycles, and Independents \~5 cycles.

If we switched to a purely popular vote, and the 2 party stays as it is, then Democrats winning every time (due to winning the popular vote) would be less fair than the current system where, at least for the past 8 cycles, have been over represented in the Presidential office.

Without consideration if the Presidential position would still function like this, a much more fair way of doing things is changing elections to be a vote for the percent of time a president will stay in office, rather than a winner taking all 4 years. Maybe any votes that add up to less than like 6 months or a year would be evenly distributed among other candidates so you don't get presidents switching out all the time.

  
I think in conclusion it just so happens Republicans are currently under-represented in office compared to their percent of votes.

Even with Harris jumping in late we couldn't get more than 65 compared to over 1,000 for Trump.  Again the take away here for many is that Trump told the truth 36 times compared to only 8 for Harris.

Also several of her half truths and lower ratings rely on taking Trump's word for on topics he's constantly lied about or flip flopped on.  For example, when Harris says Trump is going to repeal ACA, that doesn't seem like a half truth to me.  He already tried it once, he's flipped back and forth depending on the crowd about whether he wants to do it again and even when he says he won't, we'd be idiots to actually believe it.

* Hillary's campaign completely wrote off Trump, possibly until the final days of the campaign. Harris's has not.
* Trump was an energizing, dynamic campaigner who seized on a lot of issues people cared about. Trump, today, is talking about Hannibal Lecter, sharks, boating accidents, Haitians eating dogs and cats, and how much he does not want to be on the campaign trail. And he's fucking boring.
* Hillary was a competent but boring campaigner who really would have been much more suited to governing than getting voters out. Harris has been positively electric in addition to being competent.
* In 2016, Trump was kind of viewed as a sane and stable quantity. I'm not sure whether that's entirely changed, but for a lot of people it has.
* Continuing exposure to Trump benefited him when people didn't really know who this guy was. Now, it's exhausting. We've spent nine years with this guy lying about everything. Crowd sizes. His involvement with Jeffrey Epstein. Take your pick.
* In 2016, the Trump campaign was very disciplined. In 2024, they're barely a functioning organization.
* The Hillary campaign mostly disregarded the blue wall states (IIRC, there were one or two that Hillary never hit even once). The Harris campaign is spending the last few days in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, with a couple of stops in NC.
* There is no ""Comey letter"" equivalent for the Harris campaign.
* There is a ""Comey letter"" equivalent for the Trump campaign. Completely self-inflicted.

lvczqy8,"John Oliver’s monologue to undecided voters who are hesitant to vote for Harris (particularly because of Gaza) was powerful, and he hit the nail on the head. Politics is not just voting for someone who does exactly what you want *right now*. It’s also about voting for someone who you know has your same set of ideals and *can be pushed/convinced* to align with you later.

Gay marriage is a great example of this. Even Obama and Biden used to say they’re not in favor of legalizing gay marriage. But they could be convinced that it’s actually right, and then they shifted their stance. Republicans could *never* have done the same. Their evangelical base would hate it. 

And this is the same reason Mark Cuban said he endorsed Harris. Even if he doesn’t agree with her on everything (like unrealized gains tax on multi-millionaires), he says he knows Harris is actually competent and can be convinced of things if given facts. Trump will just do what his emotions or his yes-men encourage him to do. Cuban even said that “she’s not going to pass the unrealized gain tax, if she does, then I’m not supporting her next time”, indicating that he’s pretty confident that he’ll be able to convince her not to push for it.

Tariffs may benefit some kinds of factory manufacturers. About 8-9% of Americans work in factories, and substantially less in factories adversely impacted by Chinese competition.

They were a disaster for many kinds of farmers, due to retaliatory tariffs from other countries.

The USA is a net exporter of corn and soybeans, Iowa's two chief ag products. The USA is a massive exporter of corn, #1 in the world, to the tune of $8.8B in 2023.

Trump would like to withdraw the USA from the WTO, which ensures a 0% export tariff on corn among members. This withdrawal would then make US corn a very popular target for retaliatory tariffs, harming Iowa corn farmers.",2024-11-03 13:03:50,36,politics,True,0

People came from NY, NJ, CT, and other states to volunteer, and the energy was great. We met lots of Harris supporters, some registered democrats who said they simply cannot vote for Trump or anyone in the current republican party. We also met a few Trump supporters, some of them registered democrats who flipped. Some were beyond help and parroted the same shit about abortions in the 40th week and elections being stolen. But still, overall a very good day. 

The field offices in PA have tons of extra yard signs they're giving away. Some will even drop them by your house if you call in and ask. So if anyone wants a sign and doesn't have it, call or drive down to your local Harris field office.

Lastly, there are still opportunities to volunteer in the next 48 hours. Canvassing and phone/text banking. If you can spare a few hours, volunteering is easy and fun, and makes a real impact!

>Before polling began, we looked at what we thought would be the likely turnout in 2024. Every poll we conducted --- including this one --- was weighted exactly the same. We weighted party affiliation, gender, age, race, area, and education. It seems clear now that we are under sampling women, African Americans, and the City of Detroit based on absentee ballot returns and early voting. However, to assure we are comparing ‘apples to apples,’ we kept the same weights we have used all along. Because of our strong belief in transparency, we always include our crosstabs, so it is easy to substantiate our use of the same weights on every poll.

lv72yh3,"For those who were curious, Texas Early vote update - 8.9 million early vote total per UF Election lab.

I've seen conflicting data on this, with some saying 2020 was 9.7 million early votes, others are saying less, but even if that's true, that was during a pandemic environment with a full week's extra time of early voting. Hitting about 9 million in a ""normal"" election environment is very, very promising. Especially with stronger turnout in urban areas like Houston this cycle.

I cannot promise anything. Lord knows this state disappoints us so many times, but the chance of Allred beating Cruz is now very real. The catch is that we need to turn out the final group of lower propensity Dem leaning voters in the next 2 days. Reach out to them today and tomorrow and help them come up with a voting plan on Tuesday. Polls will be open 7AM-7PM on Tuesday the 5th, but are closed today and tomorrow. Polls will be open in many more locations, despite all of the state's history of shenanigans. Registered voters increased to somewhere past 18 million voters this cycle, over 1 million more since 2022 alone. Party affiliation isn't required here, so don't read into those who attempt to estimate it too much, and there are signs of weaknesses for Trump in the rural areas this cycle.

Can Texas flip? I don't know, but if it can, the turnout we generate in the next 2 days will be the determining factor. And we really, really need more Dem senators, so this election has national implications.

Help us finally send Cruz packin', and maybe we'll get some extra surprises to go along with it. If the demographic trends in the Selzer poll hold some national trends (where women living under abortion restrictions are voting against them in record numbers), that trend could easily hold nationally and impact the southern states as well (where the restrictions are just as bad, if not worse than Iowa).

lv07j7r,"Posted this in the older thread. Reposting here - 

Georgia's early voting has ended, and from an analytical standpoint, every metric I'd want to see for a Harris victory is present.

Let's break down why. 🍑

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681109546353097?s=46

Metro Atlanta finished strong, with large counties recording ~80,000 votes in just the final two hours (5-7 PM) yesterday.

Polls closed in rural counties at 5 pm, so Democratic counties drove that final surge.

This surge could preview Election Day potential.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681112780423197?s=46

Current early voting totals in key counties:

Fulton: 57.9%

DeKalb: 58.1%

Gwinnett: 54.6%

Cobb: 60.2%

Clayton: 46.3%

Chatham: 48.1%

Richmond: 42.8%

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681115032781024?s=46

The story varies significantly by county. Gwinnett, despite its size and importance, has the most ground to cover to match its total 2020 turnout.

At 54.6%, it needs 96.2% of its 2020 Election Day performance to match overall 2020 turnout.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681117633233217?s=46

Other Metro Atlanta counties have built more cushion through early voting.

DeKalb can match 2020 with 79.6% of its previous Election Day turnout.

Cobb, thanks to strong early voting at 60.2%, needs just 75.8%.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681120045027676?s=46

Fulton, Clayton, and Chatham all need about 67% of their 2020 Election Day numbers - significant cushion built through early voting success.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681140727169382?s=46

A key indicator for Harris:

Women's turnout has already exceeded 2020 levels, reaching 56% versus 55.3% in the last cycle.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681357752668251?s=46

The 2020 to 2024 comparison reveals a crucial shift: Metro Atlanta voted heavily by mail in 2020 due to COVID.

This year, a large pool of traditional Election Day voters remains available.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681444654735746?s=46

Meanwhile, rural northeast Georgia—Republican strongholds—has nearly exhausted its voter pool, with few Election Day voters left.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681538087035022?s=46

Metro Atlanta as well as other blue counties all retain substantial untapped potential voters.

Those final two hours of early voting demonstrated the capacity for high turnout in these population centers.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681756518096930?s=46

This sets up a fascinating Election Day dynamic:

Metro Atlanta and other blue counties have both more work to do AND more voters available to do it.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681878492569669?s=46

The pressure point is Gwinnett, where matching 2020 numbers will require the strongest Election Day performance relative to last cycle.

If you have some time between now and Election Day, please volunteer to canvass and help GOTV.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852682170193875302?s=46

Let's return to the Harris victory metrics:

I’m not seeing any signs of Democratic demoralization in Metro Atlanta's strong early voting numbers, while Trump faces headwinds in maxed-out rural areas.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852682392391303673?s=46

These aren't predictions - they're patterns.

But the checklist of what Harris would need for victory in Georgia has been steadily filled during early voting.

If after all of this, that

- Fundraising 10x-10000x your opponent week by week doesn't matter
- Knocking hundreds of thousands of doors and making almost a million calls per swing state doesn't matter
- Gaining heavily in red state, district, and county polls doesn't matter
- Each of the Senate candidates running 5 ahead from the presidential ticket in an age where ticket splitting doesn't happen doesn't matter
- A giant enthusiasm gap, where people are packing arenas for you of 20k-30k capacity, if not more, and your opponent isn't packing small venues of 3k to 4k doesn't matter
- A gigantic different in favorability between you and your opponent doesn't matter
- Early votes and exit polling from early voting doesn't matter
- Absorbing all of the defects from your opponent's terribly divisive campaign doesn't matter

And receiving the go-ahead from the greatest polling prognosticator in the nation doesn't matter, on top of plenty of other signs..

Everytime we talked politics it would hurt me because his actions didn’t match a Trump voter. When Biden fumbled that last debate, he was gloating that “Dems made their bed by sticking with him”.

Since then we hadn’t talked politics. I hadn’t heard his thoughts on Harris. Well I decided to text him and he opened up that while he didn’t want to lean Dem, he can’t deny Trump had fallen off since Harris took over and he saw the racism (he is dating a Latina so maybe she helped him see the light lol). And boom. He sent me a pic of his “I Voted” sticker and said it was for Harris. And for me to never bring it up again lol.

https://xcancel.com/voterstomorrow/status/1852437650457640976?s=46

According to our projected youth early vote turnout benchmarks, which are based on 2022 voting preference rates, young voters nationally have blown past their early vote turnout projection by 20%.

Projection Chart of youth turnout in PA, MI, NC, GA & National - https://xcancel.com/voterstomorrow/status/1852437651934126526?s=46

Beyond projections, data from across the country shows young voters are on track to break youth voter turnout records.

Data from the Georgia Secretary of State shows voters 18-24 years old having cast more early votes (approx. 225,000) than those aged 25-29, 30-34, and 35-39.

https://xcancel.com/voterstomorrow/status/1852437653888594406?s=46

On top of that, our team of chapters and organizers has:
- hosted over 100 actions on campuses to help register young voters
- helped over 50,000 voters access critical voting information
- made over 19 million texts and calls to young people, helping them create voting plans

https://xcancel.com/voterstomorrow/status/1852437655079788829?s=46

luya6bh,"Meidas Touch, Recap of Today in Politics, 11/1/24  
… A showdown is brewing in FL as DOJ informs the state that they intend to send in election monitors, with Desantis responding immediately that the federal monitors will not be allowing inside polling locations. Nothing like this has happened in America since the Civil Rights Movement in the 60s. Expect this to be litigated on an emergency basis immediately.

… Desantis’s Secretary of State Cord Byrd said that “the presence of federal law enforcement inside polling places would be counterproductive and could potentially undermine confidence in the election.” The confidence in GOP dominance everywhere in FL maybe.… Hopefully the case will not be assigned to Aileen Cannon.

... Mike Johnson pledged to repeal the CHIPS and Science Act which has been praised and credited by REPUBLICAN elected officials all over the country for the high tech, well paying jobs it is creating while expanding the US lead in tech with competing countries that have been rapidly catching up… This comes one day after he was caught on a hot mic pledging to repeal Obamacare.

… MI Gov Gretchen Whitmer responded that killing the CHIPS Act would be “a complete disaster for thousands of Michigan workers relying on the jobs that this legislation provides.

… Liz Cheney called on George W. Bush today to break his silence and endorse Harris: “I can’t explain why George W. Bush hasn’t spoken out, but I think it’s time, and I wish that he would.”

… The US Supreme Court has rejected an emergency appeal from Republicans attempting to prevent thousands of provisional ballots from being counted. Trump’s favorite legal analyst Jonathan Turley was critical of the decision.

… Trump went on several more unhinged, deranged rants in his appearance with Tucker Carlson last night. At one point he criticized Liz Cheney’s past foreign policy decisions and said that she should be forced to stand in front of 9 enemy soldiers with guns pointed at her face.

… Arizona AG Kris Mayes said she is investigating Trump’s comments as a possible crime: “I have already asked my criminal division chief to start looking at that statement, analyzing it for whether it qualifies as a death threat under AZ law.”

… Trump also called President Biden “a stupid bastard” and VP Harris “a sleaze bag.”

… Harris Senior Advisor Ian Sams: “Trump is talking about sending a prominent Republican to a firing squad. VP Harris is talking about sending one to her Cabinet.”

… Liz Cheney responded: “This is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death. We cannot entrust our country and our freedom to a petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant.”

… Harris made a statement to the press about Trump’s remarks: “He has increased his violent rhetoric about political opponents and in great detail, suggested rifles should be trained on former representative Liz Cheney. This must be disqualifying.”

… Last June, Trump reposted a Truth Social post that said that Cheney was guilty of “treason” and called for her to be given a televised trial before a military tribunal.   
  
… The FBI received a referral to investigate Mike Lindell’s ‘Election Crime Bureau’ after the group sent emails to elections workers asking them personal questions about their background and employment. Lindell told ABC: “I want to get rid of the electronic voting machines and you should care about it too. There’s nothing wrong with the survey.” We will see if the FBI agrees.

… Trump also claimed that he had 107,000 people at his NJ rally, 101,000 people at his PA rally, and 114,000 people at Coachella. Not even remotely close for the congenital liar.

… Senior Harris campaign officials told WaPo that their internal data shows that they are winning late deciders in battleground states by over 10 points, with most of them citing Trump’s insane and racist rally at MSG as their reason for deciding on Harris.

… Harris Senior Advisor David Plouffe: “It’s helpful, from experience (Obama 2012), to be closing a presidential campaign with late deciding voters breaking by double digits to you and the remaining undecideds looking more friendly to you than you opponent.”

… GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger says that there is a coordinated campaign on right-wing social media to spread fake videos and disinformation about the election in GA and he believes that Russia is the source of it. The most egregious video was from a man who claimed he was a migrant from Haiti and voted illegally in the election for Harris.… The Office of the Director of National Intelligence then issued a statement that the videos did, in fact, originate in Russia.

… Bannon had Scott Presler on where they complained that long lines at polling places in a heavy Republican area of PA was “voter suppression,” which has been the Democratic position for years. Bannon: “How is a working class person supposed to go and wait 5+ hours to vote?”

… Stephen Miller was melting down all day on Twitter, making panicked post after panicked post. He started off in the morning ranting about media coverage of Trump’s Cheney comments.

lv076z3,"Georgia's early voting has ended, and from an analytical standpoint, every metric I'd want to see for a Harris victory is present. 

Let's break down why. 🍑

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681109546353097?s=46

Metro Atlanta finished strong, with large counties recording ~80,000 votes in just the final two hours (5-7 PM) yesterday.

Polls closed in rural counties at 5 pm, so Democratic counties drove that final surge.

This surge could preview Election Day potential.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681112780423197?s=46

Current early voting totals in key counties:

Fulton: 57.9%

DeKalb: 58.1%

Gwinnett: 54.6%

Cobb: 60.2%

Clayton: 46.3%

Chatham: 48.1%

Richmond: 42.8%

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681115032781024?s=46

The story varies significantly by county. Gwinnett, despite its size and importance, has the most ground to cover to match its total 2020 turnout.

At 54.6%, it needs 96.2% of its 2020 Election Day performance to match overall 2020 turnout.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681117633233217?s=46

Other Metro Atlanta counties have built more cushion through early voting.

DeKalb can match 2020 with 79.6% of its previous Election Day turnout.

Cobb, thanks to strong early voting at 60.2%, needs just 75.8%.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681120045027676?s=46

Fulton, Clayton, and Chatham all need about 67% of their 2020 Election Day numbers - significant cushion built through early voting success.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681140727169382?s=46

A key indicator for Harris:

Women's turnout has already exceeded 2020 levels, reaching 56% versus 55.3% in the last cycle.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681357752668251?s=46

The 2020 to 2024 comparison reveals a crucial shift: Metro Atlanta voted heavily by mail in 2020 due to COVID.

This year, a large pool of traditional Election Day voters remains available.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681444654735746?s=46

Meanwhile, rural northeast Georgia—Republican strongholds—has nearly exhausted its voter pool, with few Election Day voters left.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681538087035022?s=46

Metro Atlanta as well as other blue counties all retain substantial untapped potential voters.

Those final two hours of early voting demonstrated the capacity for high turnout in these population centers.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681756518096930?s=46

This sets up a fascinating Election Day dynamic:

Metro Atlanta and other blue counties have both more work to do AND more voters available to do it.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681878492569669?s=46

The pressure point is Gwinnett, where matching 2020 numbers will require the strongest Election Day performance relative to last cycle.

If you have some time between now and Election Day, please volunteer to canvass and help GOTV.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852682170193875302?s=46

Let's return to the Harris victory metrics:

I’m not seeing any signs of Democratic demoralization in Metro Atlanta's strong early voting numbers, while Trump faces headwinds in maxed-out rural areas.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852682392391303673?s=46

These aren't predictions - they're patterns.

But the checklist of what Harris would need for victory in Georgia has been steadily filled during early voting.

luk5wak,"There are a number of ways to interpret the early voting numbers. First, it could be a great sign for Republicans that so many registered Republicans are voting early. BUT it is sort of meaningless if those voters were going to vote on election day anyway. You can only vote once, after all. However, if these are NEW voters who were not going to vote on election day anyway, then that’s great news for Republicans. 

On the flip side, there seems to be evidence that women are voting in greater numbers than men. If that trend continues and is sustained, that could be a strong sign for Harris.

Re the Senate and House races, voters often feel a personal connection to these candidates. So it's not uncommon for a House or Senate candidate to perform five or more points differently than the presidential candidate. Sen. Tester in Montana will likely need a sizable gap in his performance from Harris's numbers in order to keep his seat. Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio is another one who will need to do much better than Harris in order to hang on.",2024-10-30 17:09:55,0,politics,True,1

Leaving aside the fact that Trump's mob came within a couple of wrong turns down the corridor of... if not overthrowing democracy then at least plunging it into complete crisis, this rebuttal you present is actually a massive self-contradiction. Trump has spent the last 8 years since his election complaining about how it's terrible that the deep state was impeding his agenda; the ""deep state"" of course being all the public servants, medical experts, generals, etc. who restrained his worst impulses or persuaded him not to take blatantly illegal actions. 

But this time around his platform (plus promises from his running mate, advisors, likely cabinet appointments, etc.) is aimed at removing those impediments - sacking vast swathes of the public service and replacing them with loyalists who won't restrict his behaviour. Passing over ""establishment"" cabinet picks in favour of pliable goons. And so on.

So Trump is simultaneously arguing that ""it'll be fine because last time I wasn't a dictator (due to the deep state stopping me)"" and also ""this time I'll be unrestricted by the deep state because I'm going to fire them all and do what I want"".

Big fan, love watching you on election nights as the returns come in. By far the most informative of all the networks.

My question is how do you explain the disconnect we are seeing between the top-line numbers of state/national polls that points to a virtually tied race everywhere and all the other data that is pointing to at least an environment as good as 2020 for Democrats, if not a bit better?

By the other data, I'm referring to Senate polls, district-level polls, county-level polls, demographic polls, the Washington primary, etc. All these things were warning signs in 2016 despite the top-lines of polls showing a comfortable win for Clinton. Likewise, in 2020, the Washington primary predicted a much closer race than the polls were showing.

Do you think pollsters this cycle are herding? Or do you think that methodological changes they made, like many weighting to 2020 recalled vote, is going to lead to overestimating Trump in these polls? Or do you believe all that other data is wrong?",2024-10-28 17:00:21,80,politics,True,1

lu7d0dc,"Good afternoon Steve! 

  
First.  You're my favorite person to watch EVERY single election cycle.  Thanks for all the hard work you do.

  
I do not believe the polls AT all.  For a couple of reasons.

1. GOP influence to influence voter turnout (for Republicans - against Democrats).  Got it.  

2. Pollsters past history and worriment over future legitimacy.  The last poll that was correct was in 2008.  We are SO far off from that and they are all very worried about being legitimized for future polls.  I feel as if they're past performance in 2016 and 2020 was so far off that they are over analyzing and over correcting for the PRESIDENT race only.  If we look at down-ballot races we see wildy different (yet consistent) numbers but they don't match the presidential swings we are seeing.  Example: Gallego and Lake in AZ.  He is consistently ahead 6-8 points but Trump went from down 2 to now up 6?  

3. Democrats ALSO want close polls to drive voter turnout and to continue to raise the GAJILLIONS of dollars they are collecting to help defeat Cheeto Mussolini and his merry band of shadow-Nazi's.

  
My question:  Polls and actual results.

Are the results you are seeing so far correlating better with the presidential polls or ACTUALLY with down ballot polls like the Senate races and Representative races?

While millions of Americans will cast their votes in the US election, a tiny fraction of those will swing the race for one candidate or another and the voters in certain areas represent uniquely important demographics.

* Kent County, Michigan (2016 Trump +3, 2020 Biden +6.1)

That’s giving me hope that Harris’ biggest strength (Democratic-leaning female voters) are very highly motivated and mobilizing.

With that being said, based on demographics, the gender split and even how much support Biden had in 2020, the votes as of yesterday suggest she was down around ~0.9% (assuming things like third party support and splits hold at 2020 levels - they won’t of course, but that’s all I could reasonably use).

We know from solid reporting he did try to use the DOJ to persecute political opponents, but the guardrails stayed. I don't know how well they will this time, since he's going to staff it with a bunch of MAGA hacks instead of the slightly more respectable lawyers he hired the first time. 

He also makes fun of Paul Pelosi for getting almost-murdered by some Trump-loving madman. He's defended the people who tried to kill Mike Pence. So yeah, I think his desire to hurt and even kill anyone who gets in his way is very serious.",2024-10-24 16:15:34,12,politics,True,0
ltkd5wk,"What I'd say is that one of the core tenets of the movement which JD Vance articulates in his defenses of lying, is that MAGA tribal ""truths"" trump empirical reality. 

The Big Lie, which you cite, may be the cleanest version of this. It is objectively true that Biden got more votes and more electoral college votes than Trump. But it doesn't \*feel\* true to them, because those votes largely came from people they've come to believe do not deserve to be considered real Americans: People of color, white liberals, LGBTQ people, childless cat ladies, etc. 

You know how you can read or watch a work of fiction and know it's not true but it speaks to a deeper truth? I think there's emotional DNA between that and what MAGA does with ""alternative facts"" and conspiracy theories. Except the big difference is, with fiction, there's an infrastructure and context that allows us to draw a bright red line between pretend and reality. Or when you're playing an RGP. There's walls that allow the ""alternative"" truth to stay where it is, and reality to stay where it is. But what the right does is deliberately blur that distinction, so what feels true to them gets conflated with facts. 

Trump didn't invent this. He was pushing on an open door. The religious right for years has cultivated this mindset of unreality. The Satanic panic was a good example from the past.

lvgdisa,">Do you think polls overestimate trump voters who don’t respond to polls , and Harris could be leading a larger percentage?

Not likely. 

The reason that I say this is that Rasmussen and a few others are very clear about their methodology. They aren't overestimating any ""hidden"" (or ""guessed"") Trump voters. That would really destroy the credibility of a poll. 

Rather, Rasmussen is simply making a traditional ""likely voter"" based upon previous turnout. Within that, they do account for some voter enthusiasm indicators. This is where polls like NY Times-Siena are flawed (in my opinion). 

Since Joe Biden dropped out of the election, this small subset of pollsters perceive a higher enthusiasm for Kamala Harris than I believe is accurate. They base this on favorability and a gap between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. 

On average, Kamala Harris has a 4.1% better favorability compared with President Trump. However, there are some outlier polls -- and they tend to be the same polls that are favoring Kamala Harris. 

Marist, NY Times-Siena and a few others even give her a positive rating (meaning more people like her than dislike her). However, most other polls show her favorability index quite negative -- with some having it at or under President Trump's negatives. 

The problem, of course, is that this is a NATIONAL index rather than a state index. The only favorability that matters is within each of the battleground states. In those, I suspect President Trump polls higher than  nationally. The question is whether Kamala Harris would poll more negative or even with President Trump. Both (negative and even) would bode poorly for her in terms of potential enthusiasm. 

Personally, I think that the Hill and Atlas polls are more likely. The only possible exception is with Michigan and (potentially) Nevada. President Trump would still win with Pennsylvania (and/or Wisconsin). Moreover, if Trump overperforms the polls half as well as he did in 2020 in the battleground states, then I think that he will win all of the battleground states.",2024-11-04 23:32:06,3,Conservative,True,1

They didn't wake up and discover homophobia and misogyny and find trump as the answer. It's just that this time around the villains are perceived to be the Democrats and not the republicans since the Israeli war started under the democrats.

Doesn't help that Biden, Kamala, blinken and miller brush off criticism of the war. The right and social media is also pinning the blame on the democrats. Hence why muslims are leaning republican for the first time in like 20+ years.

Registered Republicans have cast about 2% more votes than Dems- which would appear to be a narrow lead. 

But in the earlier Republican primary/caucus election (NV has a weird split system) about 135000 votes were cast total for all candidates, and of those, more than 75000 of all the votes cast, or about 55% of the total, were for either Nikki Haley or ""None of these candidates"" (the biggest winner after Trump, which nearly equalled his total votes in the caucus). 

Even if just one in ten of those anti-Trump (but still Republican) voters decides to vote Harris, that still means over 5% of total Republican votes or so will actually be votes for Harris. 

In other words, it seems very likely the usual GOP/Dem split on party lines might be deceptive this go round- at least in Nevada, and those percentages may well be not too far off the mark nationwide- given how big of a chunk of the GOP stuck with Haley, even when it was clear she had no chance.

Dobbs came down in June 2022, and most states didn’t pass laws restricting abortion until after the election.

Abortion is on the ballot in 10 states, half of those are swing states, and I have hardly heard a peep about it from pollsters.

The height of inflation was June 2022 at 9.1%, and the GOP only won a six seat majority that year. Unreal. Now that Trump has been indicted, this measure is completely ignored when using 2020 recall data, as most of the polls have done.

lvdowl3,"Ellen: I think it really depends on what kind of an event it is that we’re fact-checking. 

Our reporters listen to *a lot* of speeches and interviews by the candidates, and they get very familiar with their stump speeches. When it comes to a major rally, we’ve usually heard and fact-checked whatever a candidate is repeating, so we’re listening for anything new or newsworthy.

For live fact-checking a debate, it’s a similar process, but we spend a lot of time before hand prepping things we suspect the candidates might say. (Not to brag, but our team doc to prep for the Trump-Harris debate was 100+ pages long.) One group on our team works on immediately sharing what we have prepped on social media or [our live blog,](https://www.politifact.com/article/2024/sep/10/presidential-debate-live-fact-check-harris-trump/) while another group starts working on new claims that come up so we can get a [fact-check](https://www.politifact.com/article/2024/sep/11/2024-presidential-debate-fact-check-harris-trump/) out quickly. 

And then there’s big breaking news events, like the Baltimore bridge collapse or the Trump assassination attempt in July or Hurricane Helene or Election Day, where we can’t really prepare. Breaking news can create an information gap as everyone is scrambling to get answers, and social media loves to fill that gap with misinformation. 

In these cases, we’re often in triage mode, trying to address the most serious, harmful or prevalent misinformation spreading online. That includes things like false claims about [FEMA aid](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/06/tweets/fema-gives-750-to-help-hurricane-victims-with-supp/) might dissuade survivors from getting help or disinformation that [discourages people from voting](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/nov/03/tweets/this-video-about-ballot-fraud-is-not-from-the-fbi/). It can be difficult since there might not be a ton of information available at the moment; For example, we waited to publish fact-checks about the shooter who attempted to assassinate Trump until his identity was confirmed by authorities.

lvcw1s2,"From the article: Five presidents in U.S. history have won the presidency without winning the popular vote, and the most recent to do so was Donald Trump in 2016. His opponent that year, Hillary Clinton, won over 2.8 million more votes than Trump nationwide, but she lost enough key states to be defeated in the Electoral College, 306 to 232. 

Trump lost both the popular vote and the Electoral College to Joe Biden in 2020. (Once again the electoral vote was 306 to 232, but this time in the Democrat's favor.)

> With less than 48 hours to go in the US election and more than 77.6m votes already cast, new polling shows Kamala Harris leading among early voters in the country&#039;s battleground states.

> The poll, from the New York Times and Siena College, also found Harris was slightly ahead in three swing states, with Trump up in one and the other three too close to call.

> The Trump campaign claimed the NYT polling and Saturday&#039;s Selzer poll of Iowa for the Des Moines Register were designed to suppress Trump voter turnout by presenting a biased, bleak picture of Trump&#039;s re-election prospects.

lvdvb22,"I was deeply conservative throughout my teens until I (of course) went to college and unraveled everything I had been thinking up to that time.  A moment I remember was telling my new college friends that I heard a story on Fox News.  They made fun of me so hard for that, and that was the first time I ever realized that news sources could be biased.  This was in 2010, so while not the Fox News it is now, it was still bad.

Since then I've mainly lived in NYC and have become pretty fucking liberal at this point.  Now, there's so many things I think back to and cringe about from growing up.  Things that were so normalized, and it helps me see why so many still support Trump.

  
1. Insane fear about people who don't look or act like you.  Blaming them instead of corporations or politicians.

2. Coded racism.  People used to say things like ""Oh, you get people from \*insert predominantly black area\* coming to those events.""  Which, even as a kid, you understood what they meant.

3. Calling poor people ""lazy"" even though we were almost homeless at one point.  Looking down on people that received government services.  Something we never did for some reason.

4. Complete fear of cities or going to non-white towns/cities.

5. Weirdly, a fear of public schools even within our white town.  My parents paid way too much to send us to private schools, but I then had to transfer to public when my dad lost his job.  So many kids at my private school joked that I was going to get stabbed or robbed.

  
This was all in the North East as well!  Not like we were the deep south.  However, my hometown is definitely a Trump town now, so it could very well be in the middle of Alabama at this point haha.

  
Even now, my 10 year old nephew came to visit our NYC apartment and asked ""There's a lot of drug dealers here, aren't there?"".  He's fucking 10.

Just this fear and paranoia that gets ramped up to brainwashing levels.

I've seen conflicting data on this, with some saying 2020 was 9.7 million early votes, others are saying less, but even if that's true, that was during a pandemic environment with a full week's extra time of early voting. Hitting about 9 million in a ""normal"" election environment is very, very promising. Especially with stronger turnout in urban areas like Houston this cycle.

I cannot promise anything. Lord knows this state disappoints us so many times, but the chance of Allred beating Cruz is now very real. The catch is that we need to turn out the final group of lower propensity Dem leaning voters in the next 2 days. Reach out to them today and tomorrow and help them come up with a voting plan on Tuesday. Polls will be open 7AM-7PM on Tuesday the 5th, but are closed today and tomorrow. Polls will be open in many more locations, despite all of the state's history of shenanigans. Registered voters increased to somewhere past 18 million voters this cycle, over 1 million more since 2022 alone. Party affiliation isn't required here, so don't read into those who attempt to estimate it too much, and there are signs of weaknesses for Trump in the rural areas this cycle.

Can Texas flip? I don't know, but if it can, the turnout we generate in the next 2 days will be the determining factor. And we really, really need more Dem senators, so this election has national implications.

Help us finally send Cruz packin', and maybe we'll get some extra surprises to go along with it. If the demographic trends in the Selzer poll hold some national trends (where women living under abortion restrictions are voting against them in record numbers), that trend could easily hold nationally and impact the southern states as well (where the restrictions are just as bad, if not worse than Iowa).

The election is far from 'fair and secure' and Republicans are responsible. 
  
Likewise, I am 100% confident of a 0% chance of any *legitimate* Trump victory for the following reasons:    
     
- Trump already lost to Biden/Harris in 2020    
- Covid disproportionately killed Trump voters   
- Trump voters skew older and many have died since 2020    
- Millions of younger people are now eligible to vote - and they skew heavily toward Harris/Walz.
- Harris/Walz is a wildly more popular ticket than Biden/Harris was. Most 'double-haters' are now enthusiastic Harris/Walz supporters.        
- Trump's insurrection, being found liable for rape, and felony convictions have driven some Republicans to vote against him. They have not attracted new voters *to* Trump
- Dozens of former Trump Admin officials have denounced Trump - which they *hadn't* done in 2020  
- Many Republicans and independents who voted for Trump in 2020 are now voting for Harris     
- RFK Jr. and Jill Stein are stealing votes from Trump anywhere they are on the ballot - more than they are taking votes from Harris.   
- Almost nobody who voted for Biden in 2020 is now voting for Trump, who has not expanded his base. 
- The Madison Square Garden debacle has even further incited negative voter sentiment and backlash against the Trump ticket.  
  
A *legitimate* Trump win is a near mathematical impossibility.   
  
Note the heavy-lifting being done by the word *legitimate*.  
  
Trump and the GOP have been actively engaged in widespread, nationwide conspiracy to commit election fraud since 2020, virtually unopposed by Biden's Justice Department under Republican sympathizer Merrick Garland. 
  
The fraud is so pervasive as to potentially overcome even a substantial lead for Harris on election day. 
  
Republicans have already announced and published their plans to obstruct local elections, confuse the process, steal ballots, burn ballot drop boxes, introduce errors, cause interminable delays, once again send fake electors with fraudulent results, and lean on corrupt judges to make unlawful rulings in their favor. 
  
In fact, the widespread, open, numerous and flagrant acts of election interference, disruption, obstruction, and fraud being committed by Republican voters and officials is providing a massive amount of evidence Democrats can use to contest any claimed Trump victory. 
  
At this point, there is ample reason to absolutely reject any Republican claims of a Trump win next week. Republicans have provided a mountain of justification for believing any such outcome is purely the result of fraud.  
  
The Harris campaign, Biden Administration, and Biden's Justice Department (though fat chance on Merrick Garland doing jack-shit) need to strenuously oppose any claims of a Trump win, raising challenges based on VERY apparent election interference/fraud/obstruction by Republican operatives nationwide. And unlike the 63 cases Trump lost in courts across the country due to a complete lack of evidence, there is TONS of evidence of Republican-led fraud in THIS cycle.",2024-11-02 16:16:41,3,politics,True,1

I don't know what incident you are referencing even though I wouldn't have called the 2016 Democratic primary fair regardless, but it really is an apples and oranges comparison between how a private organization like the DNC or RNC runs and operates a primary and how a general election works.

Harris was nominated the same way that every other DNC candidate was nominated, by a bunch of delegates getting together and voting for her at a designated time and place so that the nominee's name will be on the ballot for all fifty states. No Democrat challenged her, nobody was interested in challenging her, and if hypothetically they did challenge her they would have lost that challenge and Harris would still be the nominee right now, whether through delegate count or even if they had time or the rules in place for a second primary (which the DNC didn't).

Ultimately this is election is the easiest decision in the history of decisions. Do you want a senile rapist narcissistic Hitler-loving felon in the While House or Kamala Harris? Who do you think Michael Moore is going to vote for? 

And for the record I still have my Bernie Sanders shirt I bought in 2016, and supported him in the last two elections. But when I came down to it I still voted for Hillary in the general election just as I already voted for Harris this election. The only person at fault for the unusual circumstances of Harris nomination is Joe Biden, but if he didn't do what he did then Biden would be a nominee that 2/3rds of Democrats didn't want as the nominee despite primary results. He saw the bad options laid out before him and took the least worst one. If Americans are capable of making a much easier choice then this election won't even be close.

lv6za84,"Technically.

Many states have laws saying their electors have to vote for who they were sent to vote for or who won the state, or face consequences.  After.  And they’re not very scary.  A couple states allow for replacing an elector who looks like they will be wonky.

That was Trump’s plan in 2020: they sent “alternate slates” (read: fraudulent and uncertified) of electors who claimed they represented the states but voted the opposite way.  And we really don’t have a legal workaround for that.  Because yes. It is decided by the electoral college, not the popular vote.  A recent supreme court ruling may effect parts of this, but not much


Notes:

-There were 10 total defectors in 2016, out of 538 electors.  Defectors vote for the “wrong” people on day of, and the votes usually stand.  So 2 votes from my state went to Collin Powell instead of Clinton, for whatever reason the electors had.

-there are no federal standards for how electors are chosen or how they can vote.  By convention, they vote for the person who won their state or district’s election.  But each state legislature chooses their electors and there is no requirement they choose taking into account the election.  Other than the fact their constituents may well be very unhappy.

For a system stuck together with duck tape and glue, it works remarkably well.  However, it was not intelligently designed because it wasn’t designed.  The constitution allocates the electoral votes, how the state gives them out is technically up to the state.  So each state has its own wonky little system.",2024-11-02 16:16:41,2,politics,True,0

luwn9dr,"**Presenting: Grapelander's guide to not dooming about random cherrypicked high turnout rural counties in Georgia!**

There are three illusions at play in Georgia rural county turnout numbers: 

The first, many of these counties are suffering from population decay. If there's a difference in the rate at which people in general are leaving the county, and the rate at which reliable voters are, you can get counties that look like this:

2020: 10,000 registered voters, 5,000 voted, 50% turnout

2024: 8,000 registered voters, 4,500 voted. 56% turnout. 

But this can get reported as *112% of 2020's turnout already! Oh no, rurals exploding! Democrats in shambles!* by people who want you to believe that Georgia is screwed. Even though the actual raw vote numbers show fewer people voting. 

The second, on the opposite end of the spectrum, are republican leaning counties that have had huge population growth. On the surface, this seems bad. And it can be reported badly, [like this](https://x.com/cookoutEnjoyer/status/1852418864711381403). ""*Oh no, this rural Trump-dominated county has already outvoted 2020! Disaster*."" Forsyth County and a lot of the Atlanta exurbs are super prone to this. 

However....this is almost entirely down to population growth. These areas are exploding. That county has 3000 more registered voters than they did last time. And the incoming voters aren't necessarily following the trends of the county's historical voting record. [Take a look at the 2016-2020 swing map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election_in_Georgia#/media/File:Georgia_County_Swing_2020.svg) before jumping to conclusions on republican counties with growth. It may not be as bad as feared, and in many cases may in fact end up being a net margin gain for democrats. 

Notice that lots of Georgia early vote dooming and republican victory laps are reliant on cherry-picked outlier counties with data selectively reported in one of these two ways, depending on which one fits the narrative. 

Finally, the rural counties are mostly seeing dramatically higher numbers of 2020 election day voters shifting to early voting than the ruban ones are. This [extends to the racial breakdown as well](https://x.com/stphnfwlr/status/1852000284622406107). Democrats are preserving more of their likely election day vote. And some of the dem strongholds driven by the black vote that seem lagging (Clayton, Richmond, Chatham) all had *very* high election day turnout in 2020. All 3 are on pace to meet or exceed 2020 turnout if they can pull a similar election day rate. Some of the Atlanta metro counties are on pace to crush it, and/or project to see further margin gains by democrats.

Per Cook Political…

>The race for control of the U.S. House remains as close as it’s ever been. 
>
>The battleground is confined to a few dozen seats, with neither party having a clear advantage in a majority of seats. And with several competitive races in West Coast states that take longer to count their ballots, it’s highly possible we won’t know which party has control on election night.
>
> At the moment, Republicans hold 221 seats to Democrats’ 214. 
> 
> In our final House race ratings, Democrats are favored in 205 seats, while Republicans are favored in 208, leaving 22 seats in the Toss Up column. If the Toss Ups split down the middle, Republicans would maintain their majority by an even narrower 219 to 216 seat margin.
> 
> Though Republicans are favored in a few more seats, they also have a lower ceiling, since they’re defending more competitive territory. If Republicans sweep the Toss Ups, they’d pick up nine seats, while if Democrats sweep the Toss Ups they would pick up 13 seats.

We often describe Trump as ""Teflon Don"" and say that he never suffers any consequences for his actions; even for his crimes. However, one of the hosts pointed out that he and Lara Trump are sucking so much money out of the RNC to pay for his legal bills, that they don't have the money to do real ground game and GOTV efforts. This is going to directly hurt his chances of winning the election...and thus hurt his chances of staying out of prison.

It has the added benefit of sucking away money from down ballot races, and thus reducing the number (and perhaps the willingness) of elected Republicans able to try to pull some sort of shenanigans to get him off.

“It’s hard to overstate how traumatic the 2016 and 2020 elections were for many pollsters. For some, another underestimate of Mr. Trump could be a major threat to their business and their livelihood. For the rest, their status and reputations are on the line. If they underestimate Mr. Trump a third straight time, how can their polls be trusted again? It is much safer, whether in terms of literal self-interest or purely psychologically, to find a close race than to gamble on a clear Harris victory.

At the same time, the 2016 and 2020 polling misfires shattered many pollsters’ confidence in their own methods and data. When their results come in very blue, they don’t believe it. And frankly, I share that same feeling: If our final Pennsylvania poll comes in at Harris +7, why would I believe it? As a result, pollsters are more willing to take steps to produce more Republican-leaning results.”

luux9pa,"Anyone else curious about who the Unaffiliated voters are in NC? I thought I'd post some interesting information I found courtesy of UNC about their characteristics. 

Younger voters are the most likely to register as unaffiliated. Forty-six percent of voters ages 18-34 are registered unaffiliated compared to 39% of voters ages 35-54, 29% of voters ages 55-74, and 25% of voters 75 and older. As a result, younger adults, especially those ages 18-34, comprise a larger share of unaffiliated voters than the overall electorate.

Compared to the state population overall, unaffiliated voters are more likely to identify as white (66% vs. 64%). Asian (2.3%) and Hispanic (5%) voters also are more likely amongst unaffiliated voters, in comparison to the electorate as a whole, while black voters (11%) are less common. Voters who did not report a race or ethnic identification were the most likely to register as unaffiliated (53%), followed by Asian (53%), other race (47%), Hispanic (46%), multiracial (44%), White (37%), and American Indian (36%) voters. Black voters were the least likely to register as unaffiliated (22%).

Excluding North Carolina-born voters, Northeastern-born voters are the most likely to be registered as unaffiliated and account for over 14% of all unaffiliated voters. Fifty percent of voters born in both Rhode Island and Massachusetts and 49% of New Hampshire-born voters are registered unaffiliated, followed by Vermont (47%). Aside from the Northeast, just under 14% of unaffiliated voters hail from a southern state besides North Carolina, followed by 8% from the Midwest, and 4% from the West. Over a fifth of all unaffiliated voters don’t report their place of birth (22%).

Just over 875,000 unaffiliated voters — 33% of the state’s unaffiliated voter population—were born in North Carolina. New York (149K), another country (114K), Virginia (89K), New Jersey (61K), and Florida (61K) were the next most common birthplaces outside of North Carolina.

The top 10 counties for unaffiliated voters include:
Western counties of Transylvania (45%), Watauga (45%), Henderson (44%), and Buncombe (42%) Jackson (42%), and Madison (41%);
Coastal counties of Camden (45%), Currituck (43%), and Dare (42%); and Wake County (42%) in the Triangle.

luuo2hp,"As a 2000 Nader voter, I have _opinions_ on this subject of third-party voting.

Let's talk president first. Let's say you just want to get your candidate/party to 5% of the vote to qualify for PECF minor-party status for funding for the next election. Cool! That's happened 14 times in US history, most recently in 1996 with Perot. **Every single one bombed** out the next election and the majority of them dissolved afterward. No third party has every leveraged the PECF into future success, because they didn't win any power and thus couldn't do anything, and thus had nothing to run on the next election.

Maybe you're aiming higher, you think you can outright win the EC as a third party (because SteinWare are actually claiming that). Third parties took 2nd place in both 1872 and 1912! It's not that big a lift, right? Those were **4-candidate splits** and the winner still had an outright majority.

I've just now typed and deleted about two paragraphs of how the FPP and EC mathematically lead to two parties and that any deviation from that is basically punished, but I realize that's appealing to the wrong level. Let's try this:

If someone thinks that the **President** is the person that has the power to effect all the progressive change that they desire, they are _morally inconsistent_ in the following way. They do not believe in fixed hierarchies. They do not believe in kings as the best method of governance. They (hopefully) recognize that unions, communities, and collectives are the best model for action, not top-down edicts. They cannot consistently reconcile that with a unitary executive. This is not their fault! There's a lot of evolutionary pressure for humans to respond to Authority in times of stress.

So why would a progressive _candidate_ be honestly targeting the executive position without a union, community, or collective backing? Why are they not building a foundation? Why is it that out of the 520,000 elected positions in the US, the Green party (ditto Libertarian) holds **180** of them? That is not a serious movement.

And of course a lot of Brahmins are fighting back and relying on the average American's ignorance of the caste system to say that these laws are ""introducing distinctions"" when they aren't these are baked-in cultural distinctions that are incredibly old, and they were affecting people in the States.

lup2qtg,"A local attorney posted this on LinkedIn yesterday. 

You should buy a gun. Yeah, I know. You dislike firearms and wish we lived in a world without them. But ignoring reality never solves problems. The reality is that Trump may win or steal the election, and he’s made no secret about how he will govern.
Want more reality? On July 2, 2024, Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, told reporters,
“We are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless - if the left allows it to be.” A few days later, North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson ominously told supporters, “Some people need killing.” apparently referring to “socialists.”
Want more reality? In May, Trump distributed a video promising to create a “unified Reich” if elected.
Need more reality? In April, Sen. Tom Cotton publicly encouraged Americans to throw protestors off bridges.
Also in April, MAGA hero and failed candidate Kari Lake encouraged supporters to “Strap on a Glock” to prepare for the upcoming election.
These people claim to belong to the party the “Party of Freedom,” but their words and actions prove they are fascists. They loath democracy and threaten violence to get their way. Americans killed fascists overseas in World War II. We must now face the reality that American fascists may force us to kill them on our own soil.
Which brings us to why you should buy a gun. There are three reasons.
The first is to send a message. MAGA knows most Americans don’t want a fascist theocracy, so MAGA leaders routinely threaten violence to intimidate the rest of us. I’ve taught karate for a long time. Failure to stand up to bullies only emboldens them. The MAGA cult must know the rest of us are ready to fight, if necessary, to protect ourselves and our country. So, buy a gun. Learn to use it. Store it safely. Don’t threaten anyone with it.
That’s all you need do. Your mere purchase and possession of it will help restrain MAGA and fascism.
The second reason you should buy a gun is to prepare to defend yourself, your loved ones, and the weak if Trump and the fascists gain power and come for you because you speak out. You should buy a gun for the same reason you should buy a socket wrench set. You may need it someday. I hope it doesn’t come to that, but Benjamin Disraeli was right when he wrote, “I am prepared for the worst, but hope for the best.”
Let me offer a hypothetical. It’s 2027. Federal law makes it a capital offense to have an abortion. The police received a tip that your daughter had an abortion. They are approaching your front door. What will you do?
Will you let them take your daughter and execute her? You can dodge my hypothetical by telling yourself that could never happen in America. It’s a horrible choice to have to contemplate, but the horror of it does not make the hypothetical unrealistic.
The typical liberal response to my second argument is, “You can’t fight the entire United States government.” It’s a straw man argument. I do not suggest that you can or should take up arms against our government. But you can prepare for the death of democracy, if it happens, and the emergence of a theocratic police state. You can give yourself options if the worst-case scenario presents itself at your doorstep. You won’t stop evil by yourself, but wars are not won by the actions of one person. They are won by the cumulative sacrifices of many.
The third reason you should buy a gun is to protect yourself from the MAGA cult. They preach hate toward gays, minonities, immigrants, disabled people, and anyone who disagrees with them. They preach hate toward government itself. They are armed, ignorant, and filled with hate, and that makes them a danger to every person that is not a white, Christian male.
The law defines negligence as a failure to do an act which a reasonably careful person would do, or the doing of an act which a reasonably careful person would not do, under the same or similar circumstances to protect oneself or others. Don’t be negligent.
When I wrote the first draft of this piece a few months ago, I shared it with a friend I trust and respect.
She told me it was defeatist. Since then, the Supreme Court abolished the principle that the President is not above the law, and Trump is quoting Hitler more frequently. Career military leaders, mostly Republicans, are telling us Trump will rule like a dictator.
I pray I am wrong. I hope that years from now people read this and laugh at me. I could handle that. What would be worse, though, would be to remain silent and see these fascists take America without firing a shot. You should buy a gun.",2024-10-31 13:07:07,1,politics,True,1

LANSING, MICHIGAN –  “I remember that I was leading services, and someone came up to me and said Rabbi, something terrible has happened. That’s how I learnt there was something horrible amiss,” says Matthew Kaufman, Rabbi of Kehillat Israel.

“Of course, things only got worse from there. The community has been torn apart in many ways by 7 October and the subsequent war. It struck very personally, even though we’re here in Lansing, Michigan, very far away from what happened. Thousands of miles away, there is still a connection.”

There are few American communities untouched by the conflict continuing to escalate in the Middle East, and Michigan’s capital city is no exception.

A Michigan State University student with friends at the local mosque died alongside 17 of his relatives in an Israeli air strike on Gaza.

The 79-year-old relative of one of Lansing’s Jewish congregation was taken hostage by Hamas on 7 October and died in captivity. Many in Lansing have watched relatives and friends suffer in the region.

The conflict has proved to be one of the most divisive issues of the upcoming presidential election, and triggered a surge in both Islamophobic and anti-Semitic hate crimes.

But faith leaders in Lansing have worked to forge a different path.

On that, you and I simply disagree. I WILL outright dismiss it *as a reliable source*. Sure, a broken clock is correct twice a day and many of their articles hold truth, but an unbiased source, from the ruler of Qatar, when the balance of the middle east rests partly on this election? Hell no. 

The OP didn't ask 'what are some sources that aren't totally trustworthy but that I'll be able to spend time countering with other sources until I uncover the buried truth?' I think they want to do as little reading as possible. 

I just don't see the value in the exercise you propose, and it is definitely not what OP was asking for. OP is not trying to bolster their own argument and counter others. They simply want some fair info, quickly, easily. 

I also did not say to ignore al jazeera. We all encounter AJ articles all the time. But is it what OP was looking for - an unbiased source? No.

I believe that, despite the subsidies from government grants dedicated to the arts, NPR is not 'owned' by the US government and does not take direction from it, like AJ does. I do not believe NPR is a voice of the current American administration which is how it would be if it was controlled by the federal government. I do not think NPR'S relationship to the American government is the equivalent of AJ's to the Qatari, despite funding from the national broadcasting act.

I don't know how to do the quote thing, but you said that I don't extend the same criticism of bias to the pro-israel papers like NYT and WaPo. I'll just take this opportunity to say that I think NYT, CNN and WaPo are biased and I don't recommend them as an individual, one-stop shop for unbiased election info for someone who wants quick answers. Get that cleared up there. However, they are still not equivalent. I do not know that Jeff bezos arms the IDF. They are biased for other reasons I guess. 

But you included NPR and called them pro-zionist. If you mean they are pro Israel-existing-as-a-country, I can not argue that, as only a monster would argue for the eradication of an entire country.

It's not like the laws of physics, which are predictive because they mechanically cause the outcomes of events; systems like this, which try to predict something as unstable and random as an election, will only ever be right until they aren't.

The model is also demonstrably incoherent when applied in some contexts, so for example the existence of a strong third party candidate is taken to provide an advantage to the challenger party regardless of what platform the third party stands on. Imagine if Trump lost the primary this year, and then ran as a third  party candidate with a ""MAGA party"", splitting the conservative vote. According to the keys, this would help the Republicans to win, but this obviously could not be further from the truth when examined practically. RFK Jr's endorsement of Trump, according to the model, hurt him more than if RFK Jr stayed in the race and kept attacking both Trump and Kamala.",2024-11-04 12:39:59,39,Conservative,True,1

luikacj,"**From The Telegraph Economics Reporter, Melissa Lawford:**

  
Gold demand has exceeded $100bn (£77bn) for the first time as [investors race to secure the safe-haven asset](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/investing/news/wealthy-stockpile-gold-silver-coins-labour-tax-raid/) before the [US election](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us-election/).

The value of global gold purchases between July and September surged by 35pc year-on-year, according to a report from the World Gold Council.

Traders responded after the price of gold hit successive monthly highs between July and September, with the total weight purchased over the quarter rising 5pc year-on-year to hit 1,313 tonnes.

The surge in activity has come amid a growing sense of uncertainty surrounding the US election on Nov 5, as well as high geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.

Strong demand pushed average London Bullion Market Association gold prices across the quarter up 28pc year-on-year, over which period they hit a record high of $2,474/oz.

Gold prices have hit a record high on 30 different occasions since January, climbing again on Wednesday to reach $2,779/oz.

Louise Street, senior markets analyst at the World Gold Council, said there was a “fear-of-missing-out factor” amongst investors.

Ms Street said: “Investors have shown an appetite to buy into the price momentum, are encouraged by the prospect of future interest rate decreases and are also considering gold’s role as a safe haven in the face of US political uncertainty and escalating conflicts in the Middle East.”

Heightened levels of gold demand from Western traders have offset a recent dip in sales in Asia, industry experts added.

The geographical split has [emerged as markets bet on Donald Trump succeeding](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/10/21/why-prospect-trump-election-victory-triggered-scramble-gold/) in the upcoming US election, with the Republican candidate expected to pursue an inflationary economic agenda.

One of Trump’s key promises is to implement [widespread trade tariffs](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/10/29/why-trump-could-crush-the-british-economy/) of up to 20pc on the value of goods coming into the US from other countries and up to 60pc on imports from China.

Economists have warned this would drive up the cost of goods, with Morgan Stanley estimating that tariffs could add nearly a whole percentage point to the US rate of inflation.

Meanwhile, while the price of gold keeps climbing, [oil prices have fallen sharply](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/10/28/ftse-100-markets-latest-news-uk-budget-reeves-landlords/) in recent days after Israeli air strikes avoided Iranian oil and gas facilities. The price of Brent crude on Wednesday was $71.93 per barrel, down by $9 since early October.

>>*In four years, realistically. Unless blue figures their stuff out you all have those four years and a midterm to do it.*

JD will be declared president due to the rapid cognitive and mental decline of Trump.

>*If he is reelected, former President Donald Trump, now 78 years old, would be the oldest president ever elected. After a number of appearances where his remarks were rambling or incoherent, and one event in which he swayed silently to music on stage for close to 40 minutes, questions are being raised about possible cognitive decline.*

There are true signs.

>*There are people who count syllables, and they count the speech rate, and they count the number of things like how much he curses and things like that, and have noted changes. They have noted changes in his syntax, the grammatical complexity of his language.*

His family has a history of dementia.

It's hereditary.

>*So, again, not making a formal diagnosis of dementia - you need to actually assess him formally and face-to-face in order to do that. You can't diagnose anyone in absentia. But what we're seeing is real, and it's - part of the challenge is, so, look, again, he's 78 years old. If this was your grandfather, you probably wouldn't think twice about it. Again, we all decline with age. What I'm seeing is more challenges with the thought processes, that, again, I'm not saying that he has dementia, but they are suggestive of, if you sort of took this all in totality, right?*

Trump has all of it.

>*So, problems with memory loss, communication difficulties, changes in mood, poor judgment, personality changes, those in total are what really the symptoms of dementia.* 

I will **repeat what I said before.**

I would not trust this man with my children.

Why would I trust him with my country or with **any interaction he needs to have on the world stage?**

Yikes!

That said, I was mostly thinking about how he only gets any coverage since he dropped when he says or does something that is construed as a gaffe, most recently demonstrated by the unbelievably outsized coverage of the ""garbage"" comment. An article in Time today framed the garbage comment as a symptom of his supposed current desperation to remain relevant. I think analysis like that is ridiculous, personally.

Talk to friends and family and sell them on Harris.

She has an economic plan approved by hundreds of economists.

It’s comprehensive. And she doesn’t just say “tariffs, tariffs, tariffs “ because unlike Trump, she understands that would make imports more expensive for Americans and lead to higher inflation.

Plus she doesn’t threaten to end the first amendment like Trump has when he threatened to imprison journalists, critics and non-Christians.

Plus she doesn’t threaten to end the Second amendment like when he said in Feb 2018 “take the guns first, due process later.”

Plus she doesn’t threaten to terminate the entire Constitution like Trump did in December 2022.  you know, the whole “we the people “ document folks have on their bumper sticker.

Jon Stewart did a really good segment on how the candidates are being warped by the media.

We can do this.

“Michigan is expected to clear 606,800 inactive voters from the rolls, but that won’t be completed until 2027. Federal law requires voters to be removed from the rolls by state or local officials if the state is notified that they moved to a different state or if election mail sent to their home is returned as undeliverable. Voters are also removed if they do not vote in two consecutive federal elections.”

Effectively, these people have moved on in life and they haven’t updated their status.

The issue isn’t voter fraud. You can’t vote in two places as you have to register of course. 

The issue however, again taken from the same article: 

“If voter registration lists include names of voters who should no longer be on the list, the RNC may spend more resources on mailers, knocking on doors, and otherwise trying to contact voters, or it may misallocate its scarce resources among different jurisdictions.”

Illegal alien A shows up in Michigan, and steals the identity of US citizen B, who lives in New Jersey, in order to work.

Illegal alien A uses the stolen identity to get a drivers license in Michigan and is automatically registered to vote.

Michigan does not check to see if the identity is real.  The IRS identifies the Michigan identity as false, but tells no one.  The NJ US citizen has no idea his identity has been stolen.

An absentee ballot is requested for the Michigan illegal alien (not necessarily by the illegal alien), and he is put on the permanent ballot list, which means in future elections he will automatically be mailed a ballot without having to request one.

Since the Michigan illegal alien put down a residence address of the stash house he was staying at when he got his license, the ballots will be mailed there - along with the ballots for hundreds of other illegal aliens who have stayed there over time.

Come election time, the ballots will be collected (and voted) by a third party.

It has already been demonstrated that there is no significant signature verification, so those ballots are accepted.

Right... Trump was the one calling the other side ""deplorables"" and talking about how evil and fascist they were.  The ugly truth is that the left has gone into a purity spiral, and they are more than happy to throw the other side under the bus.  You claim that there are studies confirming what you say, but are they really?  It's a fact that we are more polarized, but the source is the leftist media, not Trump.

You remember that time Trump got shot?  That was because of all the stochastic terrorism from the left over the years.  I mean really, they have been directly comparing him to Hitler.  It's plain to see.

>he weakened NATO

I thought libertarians wanted less big government bodies?

>he started trade wars

Is it a bad thing to protect our markets from foreign sabotage?  If China can produce goods at a lower price because they're willing to exploit their people, is that a good thing?  Especially if it comes at the cost of American jobs?

>he politicized the justice department

When?

All I remember is the numerous raids on his and his allies' houses at 3am.  All 34 fake felonies from the kangaroo court, where the banks he supposedly defrauded testified in his defense, saying they were happy to do business with him?

Smells like projection to me.

>he relentlessly attacked the media and eroded press freedom

You're right that he's attacked the media.

They deserve it.

The media has been absolutely disgusting in their coverage of him, some networks were 90% or more negative coverage of Trump.  The media does not honestly report the truth, they create narratives that they're paid to create.  For example, the Hunter Biden laptop story which has now been proven to be real was denied as Russian propaganda.

As for erosion of press freedom, that was more Obama's thing.  If you can show me a single instance of Trump actually harming a reporter, I'd be shocked.

>his admin was probably the worst example of nepotism in government we’ve ever seen

Hunter Biden and Burisma.  Joe even bragged on camera about getting the prosecutor fired.

How was Trump nepotistic?

>he directly corruptly profited from his presidency (eg made foreign officials stay in his hotels) in an unprecedented manner

Now, by only listening to Acosta (one of the most respected journalists on TV), you’d think that Trump was calling for Cheney to be facing a firing squad. So I tuned into FOX to see what they had to say. Turns out that Trump was referring to the fact that Cheney was a chicken hawk who favors sending American troops to fight in foreign conflicts, but doesn’t serve in the armed forces. He was saying that Cheney would not want to be facing enemy rifles trained on her. By the way, I also include Dick Cheney as a chicken hawk.

Then if he were to win he'd look like the biggest clownshoe. Yet his supporters won't care.

However my first line is how you or anyone knows he's full of shit. It's super easy to see, you barely have to pay attention. Trump sees the world through ratings covered glasses.

If he's perceived terribly, he seems that he's the best there ever was and everyone is saying it.

When he KNOWS reversing Roe v Wade was on a majority a bad decision per the polling of a majority of Americans showing support for legal abortions with limitations, what those are has always been the contention since Roe came into being.

So instead, he sells it as ""everyone wanted this"" which is far from even remotely true, whatsoever. 

His brain is mush, but he is conscious enough to still see the world through those ratings lenses, he's conscious enough to know when he lost. He is conscious enough to see when he is perceptually being seen negatively or if he is even suggestively losing he will increase rhetoric of cheating and latch onto anything that is useful for selling that lie as believable.

Both sides of this argument called this right after he left office. The left said he'd run again to avoid oncoming legal culpability because it was coming no matter what. The documents case is an absolute slam dunk. The man is guilty af and Aileen Canon is either corrupt, incompetent, or both.

The right said at that time that the government would come after him to stop his next run. It's like a terrible soap opera my mom used to watch. It's utter garbage.

Which is more believable?? I choose to believe that the man who is now barred from running a charity because he embezzled funds from his own charity, money slated to be given to cancer kids, to buy a portrait of himself is exactly the person who has been on display right infront of our eyes.

A man who cheats people out of hard earned money in campaign donations by not properly informing those that donate it is a recurring payment.

A man who has cheated hundreds of contractors out of money owed off of a likely very scummy clause of work quality or something OR more likely than actual legal jargon in a contract it's likely he just knows they can't afford to take him to court and doesn't even need to bother.

A man who stole hundreds of classified documents that we don't even know the full scope of yet and may never.

Yeah, this ain't difficult. The charity thing alone is so utterly disqualifying. That's not even a personality thing. That's flatout unprofessional, illegal, scummy, EVIL shit. Oh yeah, ridiculously egotistical and vain.

Edit: and because the charity case is already adjudicated its how I know the ""it's doesn't cost $60000 to bury a..."" comment is definitely true.

He values life so little if it isn't his own. It shows how we weighs life. Like who takes chairty money intended for cancer kids? Someone who sees that money being sent to those kids a pointless because they have cancer. Just like he would find it senseless to spend that much money to bury a soldier.

In that vein, I just think he's removed the expectation of civility and peaceful transfer of power from the table, and I also think that he has created an existential threat to the continuance of America as a democracy by his embrace of dictators (not just his favorite, Hitler, but also current ones like Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin) and totalitarianism (as exemplified in his demands for loyalty to him personally instead of the Constitution and the duties of office, and his embrace of Project 2025).  

If you foment an insurrection and get people killed trying to stay in power, why would you expect everyone else to be a better and more law-abiding person than you, faced with the threat of you getting back into the office you committed treason trying to keep the first time you had it?  I mean, almost everyone on the planet IS a better person than Trump, but he has no right to expect them to act like it in a moment of crisis.  Or at all.  He has no moral standing to expect to be protected from the results of his actions.

The Secretary of State has reported that 613,000 votes have already been cast by people who didn't vote in 2020 at all. That's to date and we still have 5 days to go. Statistically, the higher voter turnout is, the better Democrats perform. This has been true of every election for the past 50 years. 613,000 is a lot of additional votes. Analysts are predicting that Harris will take Georgia, probably by a significantly larger margin than Biden did. If you understand how our electoral college works, this spells big problems for the GOP moving forward. If Georgia turns blue, meaning that the state will vote for Democrats reliably, the GOP might not elect a president again in the foreseeable future. The same trend is happening in North Carolina and Texas, albeit slower. The GOP has alienated African Americans, Latinos, and now, young women as well. They have a huge demographic problem that has been lurking for several election cycles.

I believe that the polls are expecting turn-out among women to wane from the previous cycles where the Dobbs ruling was a significant factor.  This is precisely what was wrong with polling in 2022 midterms and various other state elections since Dobbs. 

You’d think the polls would account for this, but I suspect the thinking is that the Dobbs decision has already had a turn-out impact, and everything forward  will reflect a return to previous cycles.  

I don’t think this will prove to be true.  I think the passion around this issue is just as much a factor as ever, and many women, in many states have yet to log a vote directly on the issue.  

Trump could have adopted a tactic to present a softer stance to dissipate some of the energy on this issue.  But he doubled down and leaned into a pro-life position.  He bragged about Dobbs and made many ridiculous statements on the matter (e.g. everyone, including democrats wanted Roe overturned).

ltulgwi,"Came to say this. The problem with the polls isn’t the answer, it’s the mapping they’ve chosen on how those answers line up with Likely Voters. If you were to project those same answers into all Registered Voters, it would be Harris by miles. 

So what’s the difference? It will have to be first time and infrequent votes, and while there’s no hard evidence, anecdotally as you say college students are putting the effort into voting in their home towns, finding their polling location, getting it done early - something traditionally the 18-34 crowd is terrible at, often being a day late and a dollar short on finding time and knowing how to vote. 

I think the voting totals might show the highest percentage of Registered Voters ever. 

Apparently there were 161 million RVs in 2022 but 168 in 2020 - it dropped between them because a certain number die, some get purged in *normal* cleanups, and some don’t re-register when they move cause they don’t have a strong reason to. A whopping 158million/168m of 2020 voted (94%),  for contrast in Hillary’s election, suppressed enthusiasm led to only 137m/158m (86.7%) voted, about 21m registered-but-not-voting (RBNV) sat out, while last time to throw Trump out only 10milion voters were RBNV. (94% of registered voted)


So if this years registrations go up past 2020 - and this does seem likely, with the way both sides are scrambling their friends to register, we could see, let’s say maybe 96% of registered vote AND the total registered goes up to 175m - that would be about 7 million sitting out but 168m votes cast, ie about exactly 7m more voters. I think that tilts a lot of states real high, and swing states about a solid 51.5/48.5.

Let’s hope!

But then 2022, the GOP under-performed polling in the same way after they likely tried to correct for the last few years.

Or both, and it’s a turnout game?” And I think we just won’t have any idea until Election Day; trying to read the tea leaves every day just stresses me out.

Also, to your quote about Plouffe, he’s saying the same thing you are, but reasoning from the opposite direction. He says most public polls are garbage, yes, but then says it’s because the race is stupid-close. Not that Dems may over-perform. He’s stressing that it’s all a turnout game.

As an example, I heard a co-worker on the phone with her boyfriend the other day, and I could overhear everything he was saying to her, and I heard him say, ""The first woman president, and she's not even white. It's not fair."" 


I'm not saying this because I enjoy calling out clumsy or controversial comments or views (the comment I made was clumsy) but because IT'S TRUE! Because I've lived on the East Coast and in the Midwest, and in southern states and northern states, and I've been around a lotta white people, and it's true. That doesn't mean they're white supremacists, per se, though some apparently are; it means they've absorbed negative, fearful messaging about people of color, and many of them haven't even been exposed to enough black people in more than a passing way, in order to draw a different conclusion.

The fact is, people make vague claims that's she's ""unlikable"" because they typically don't have substantive criticism, and because gender discrimination is a real thing too.",2024-10-26 06:00:20,0,PoliticalDiscussion,True,-1

We must live in different universes indeed. I am genuinely excited about Harris specifically, as are many people I know. She is extremely qualified (has experience in all three branches of government), shares most of my values, has great relationships with our international allies, and has spent her entire career fighting for the little guy. Even with LGBT issues, she was one of the first politicians to fight for their rights (before Obama, Biden, etc) and even officiated one of the first homosexual marriages that took place in California. Her economic plans have been evaluated by so many economists and institutions at this point and they argue that it would curb inflation and spur our economy. 

She also has a really interesting way of approaching policy analysis. If you know anything about her record or heard interviews on how she approaches policy and governance, she tends to use all sorts of data to analyze the issue from every angle and determine what underlying factors are leading to the trends. Often her out-of-the box thinking leads her to identify underlying causes that one wouldn't suspect are related to a trend in a specific field (such as the connection between school attendance and murder victims). She also pushes her staff and teams to develop rationales for any ideas they propose. If you've heard interviews with her staff, she asks them really tough questions about why they are suggesting a specific course of action, and wants to see concrete evidence of impact before moving forward with a particular idea. So she has a great balance of trusting and delegating to smart people, but challenging them to justify their advice.

ltwdnru,"I do think Donald Trump has a better shot at winning this election, but I wouldn't be surprised if Harris wins against betting odds.

Betting usually happens in the background, but this year, Donald Trump and his running mate Elon Musk have frequently advertised their numbers online, this has caused the number of right-wing bettors that consume ""red-wave"" sources on those platforms to soar. When Trump's betting odds soared in mid-October, nothing fundamentally changed from the beginning of the month, except, well, Elon Musk promoting the platform when Trump took the slightest lead. The next day, Trump's odds soared to 60%, and that was no coincidence. The wisdom of the crowd loses functionality if most of the bettors are all coming straight out of a MAGA rally. 

But why don't Kamala Harris supporters join in to make lots of money? I am sure they are, but I wouldn't be surprised if some are nervous. No candidate has won the election when their opponent leads by 20% in the betting markets in October. There are a lot of hard-core bettors who are inclined to bet against that, but is your average gambling Joe going to? It might be becoming a sort of bubble, where people bet Trump *because* he is leading by so much on these platforms.

1. The current betting pool for the election is well over $2B, so a single $10m bet is not going to make a big difference. 

2. Betting on a candidate is not akin to any kind of market manipulation - what market are you trying to influence?

3. Betting on elections is a uniquely singular process, different from sports betting in a primary fashion - bettors have an opportunity to directly impact the outcome when THEY cast their vote. The same can’t be said for people who bet on, say, an NBA game. 

4. The oddsmakers have a direct incentive to predict the outcome correctly. They need to balance the flow of money and/or have the favorite win so they don’t end up massively in the hole when it comes time to pay everyone. 

In the example that has been given multiple times about large $10m bets coming in for Trump, if that was enough to move the needle, they would offset that action by dramatically improving the odds for Kamala so they could draw money back to the opposing stance. The net impact of this is how you get the “line” - and it corrects quickly, based on money flow.

This is why the market doesn't reflect the reality of the race. The race 1 person votes cancelation out another's, it doesn't take 1.5 million voters to cancel out 1 persons vote like this betting market requires. Either that or you need 1 person to bet 30 million in kamala favor.

I'm not shitting on people who bet in it or saying you have to be rich to bet in it. I'm saying rich people can sway it. The fact that musk can bet 100mil tomorrow and skew the odds 5% makes this whole thing inaccurate and is just dependent on an equal number of gamblers on both sides with an equal number of resources both betting at the same volume. The fact is, volume is a measurement that doesn't apply in terms of individual voters.

Maybe this will help.

In an election the only factor that matters is the number of voters. 

If team As # of  voters > team Bs number of voters, team A wins. If not, team b wins. Simple, only 1 factor matters and that is voter numbers

On the betting markets there are 2 factors to determine the odds, 1 is # of betters and the other is the size of the bet 

If team As # of betters > team Bs number of betters, the odds can show that team B is winning because of the factor of  bet size being greater. 

Thus factor throws off the market by accounting for the size of bets, when an election the only thing that matters is the number of voters. It doesn't matter how enthusiastic a single voter is, or how much money they have, every vote is worth 1, every bet is not worth 1, therefore 1 really enthusiastic better betting 10 skews the data.",2024-10-26 05:11:41,2,PoliticalDiscussion,True,1
ltw73fu,"That's actually why they can't interfere with betting odds. Because the odds are determinitive of pay out. You also now have an unknown hand weighing things out which is another thing that skews the results because now it isn't even reflective of what betters want or how confident betters are on their candidate, now it is just about what 1 company needs the odds to be to stay in business. 

It doesn't have to reflect the actual likelihood of a candidate winning, it only has to reflect the amount of money put in - their profit margin. 

I'm sorry, we have gone through the math and now you are saying the house has supernatural knowledge of how voters will really vote (not based on polls) and will be able to manipulate the betting market to reflect reality regardless of money put into the market. You understand how everything you're arguing leads to less accuracy in the market right? Like you're now adding more factors that don't exist in an election. Because now the market isn't just about the number of betters, which BTW is the only factor in an election is the number of voters. Now you've added weighted voting where some voters hold more valuable votes, but now you have introduced a deep state element that will change the tallies to reflect the reality they believe will happen. And are claiming the the voters being weighted and the hand of the deep state are gonna be more accurate than polls that only factor in the number of voters. 

There are too many external factors in betting markets for them to be accurate in an election. Thats just the reality. Doesn't mean you can't bet on them or like them. But they are too easily manipulated to look at them and say they are the most accurate.

So the question becomes, why are people like trump and musk telling you that the most manipulatable ""poll"" is the most accurate. The answer is simple. They want you to believe in those markets so if they lose they can point and say ""no, polymarket said we were up 20% there's no way we lost read claim the election was rigged.

Israel is the aggressor, the U.S. is highly likely to be involved.  Has been involved in previous attacks.  Is currently involved in intelligence gathering on Iran that it shares with Israel, sends aid and weapons to Israel.

Israel is the entity that started the conflict, by illegally militarily occupying Palestine and repeatedly engaging in attacks on Iran.  Committing genocide in Palestine, illegally kidnapping and holding hostage thousands of Palestinians annually.  Illegally seizing territory.  Illegally displacing residents of a country they have no legal right to.

You have Israel assassinating Iranian scientists, stuxnet, Israel targeting Iranian nuclear sites, Israel seizing Iranian shipping.  Israel attacking and assassinating Iranian military and government personnel, sites and equipment in Syria. 

Oct 7th happened after the amending of the 2005 Disengagement Plan and the destruction of hundreds of Palestinian homes and the displacement of Palestinians.  The Knesset saying it would reclaim Greater Israel which includes the entirety of Palestine and Jordan, and Netanyahu at the United Nations with a map of Israel titled the New Middle East that claims all of Palestine for Israel.

And recently the Israeli illegal attack on the Iranian embassy in Syria.  


Lets review...  Israel is in violation of international law militarily occupying Palestine.  Israel has no right to block weapons shipments to Palestine under any international law in existence.  Iran has an inherent right to have trade with Palestine, Lebanon and supply them with weapons.  Israels invasion of Lebanon was and is illegal.  Israel continues to this day to illegally occupy Lebanese territory as well.

A measured response would actually be Israel doing absolutely fucking nothing.

Israel is not a liberal democracy.  Its a theocratic apartheid ruled by a terrorist political party.  In order for a country to be considered a democracy everyone has to have representation.  Israel claims Palestine as their territory.  Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza do not have representation in the Knesset, its not a democracy in the slightest.  Likud is a right wing political party founded by the leader of the terrorist group Irgun.  The current Minister of National Security is leader of a right wing terrorist political party founded by members of the Kach terrorist group.  The IDF itself was formed from the terrorist group Haganah.  Benjamin Netanyahu was literally elected to office because he was holding violent rallies calling for the assassination of Prime Minister Rabin with right wing Kahane terrorists due to the fact that he was willing to have peace talks with Palestinians.  And as a direct result Rabin was assassinated.

In 1967?  You mean when Israel illegally invaded Egypt and illegally seized surrounding states territory.  And attacked and killed U.S. service members on the U.S.S. Liberty.  The simple reality is that Israel is a illegitimate terrorist state.

Israel had been committing genocide, displacing Palestinians, refugees were flooding into neighboring states.  Israel was angry that states like Lebanon were not policing the refugees that Israel created.  Palestinians wanted their land and their homes back and were attacking Israel.  Israel illegally invaded Lebanon in 1982 and sent militants into refugee camps to slaughter civilians.  The United Nations classified this as acts of genocide.  Israel then proceeded to cluster bomb residential neighborhoods in Lebanon.  These illegal actions is what caused the formation of Hezbollah.  Israel then illegally seized Lebanese territory and still to this day continues to illegally occupy parts of Lebanon.

In 1987 Israel illegally killed civilian Palestinian workers returning from a refugee camp and Palestinians started to protest by closing shops in Palestine, refusing to travel to Israel to work, and blocked roads in Palestine.  Israel in response illegally sent 80k IDF soldiers into Palestine and slaughtered 1000 Palestinians.  This illegal action is what caused Hamas to be formed.  The only reason Hamas gained control of Gaza was due to Israels illegal assassination of Palestinian leadership, illegal limitation of travel to and from Gaza and the West Bank and the continued illegal seizure of land.  And recently under Biden, U.S. pressure being applied on current PA leadership to resign.

The conflict in Yemen was a domestic conflict, U.S. and Saudi Arabian interference violated the U.N. Charter as well.

Then maybe it can stand on its own and use its own definition for the word genocide.

Hamas did not provoke anything.  Israel amended the 2005 Disengagement Plan and illegally seized hundreds of Palestinian homes, illegally displacing hundreds of Palestinians, all while continuing to illegally kidnap and take hostage thousands of Palestinians a year...This was while the Knesset openly declared all of Palestine and Jordan to be seized by Israel.  Israel provoked Hamas...Israel provoked the Palestinians, since its Israel who is the aggressor in every single interaction you can possibly list.

Palestine has a right to attack Israel, Israel has no right under international law to self defense from Palestine.  It has no just cause.  No right to war, jus ad bellum.  Israel is an illegitimate state, the acquisition of territory through use of force has been a violation of international law since before Israel was founded.  Israel has been violating Palestinians territorial integrity since Zionist terrorist groups declared independence in violation of international law.

The Ultra Orthodox Jews?  You mean the anti-Zionist Jews right?  The Jewish people that the Zionists routinely targeted for assassination.

That is clearly revenue positive and not some $1.35 loss in revenue.  For inflation what matters is increasing revenue to fight it.  We did that greatly with the TCJA.

It didn't even become a named variant until end of May and became globally dominant in June 2021.

How can this be done and still be legal??

“[….] Then, regardless of how many votes [the Democratic candidate] won by, electoral or popular, the House simply refuses to certify the electoral college votes of enough states that the minimum of 270 isn’t reached. Under the 12th Amendment, like with the election of 1876, that throws the election to the House, where each state has one vote.

While a majority of Americans live in a state run by Democrats, a majority of the states themselves are run by Republicans. Each state gets one vote for president in the House, and right now 26 state delegations are GOP-controlled, meaning that a majority of the House would simply vote to put Trump back into the White House, 26-23(Pennsylvania’s delegation is 50/50). All totally legal.”

In trumps first term, our economy was the greatest it had been since the 70s. 

This is able to be proven, as 2016-2020, american citizens had the lowest cost of living since the 70s. As well as lower taxes, my personal property tax has gone up over $1500 since the biden administration took office. 

He removed tons of troops from Afghan, troops that were dying for no reason, and fighting a battle that wasnt ours. 

Trump single handedly brought the war in the middle east to a complete standstill, thanks to tariffs. 

Trump greatly helped our relationships with some of the worlds strongest super powers, including russia, china, and north korea. 

Trump worked hard to make our country energy independent, meaning that we were no longer buying oil from other countries for some time. We were told by many democrats that there was no oil to be drilled in america, trump proved that we are one of the most oil rich countries in the world, thanks to alaska and texas.

The towns and villages, they’re being inundated. **But I don’t think they have the problem in terms of Election Day. I think the bigger problem are the people from within**. We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics.

But it's a self fulfilling prophecy, and a collective action problem; if they didn't obey in advance, the authoritarian wouldn't be able to seize power.

The second is because it costs Trump nothing. He will neither lose votes nor suffer any additional legal peril for making these threats. Since there's no risk and only upside benefit, of course he will make these threats.",2024-10-23 05:17:44,11,PoliticalDiscussion,True,-1

You...you think they're going to tell a random person who calls up about their security plans? I'm sure Adam Schiff is aware of what Trump is saying. I think the staffer was simply taken aback by your question. She may not be privy to the specifics either, but she knew she couldn't tell you regardless and just wanted to politely get you off the phone. There may have been a smoother answer (""I can't discuss this with you, thanks for your concern for the Congressman""), but keep in mind she may not be that experienced. Or she may just not have expected the question you apparently asked because it's not something the public or constituents are entitled to know.

I'm not fully confident Democratic leaders have an effective plan as a group if Trump takes power, and individual plans may be all over the map (and for some may include putting a priority over fighting for the common good over ""their own liberty"")...but I know in their shoes I wouldn't be showing all my cards, and I would also need to see what actually happens first. Trump made a lot of noise about locking up Hillary last time and then did nothing. Not that I don't think there's a lot of danger in his second term--we very well may see Democratic leaders locked up this time--but he's a huckster first and foremost and his promises don't come to fruition 100% of the time. One of the strategic advantages Democrats have in a free-for-all situation is Republicans may underestimate them as weak.

From a metaphysical perspective, as opposed to a purely sociopolitical one, the entity currently known as 'DJ Trump' shares this appallingly negative trait in common with other such unevolved and abusive entities now in positions of power, among them Putin, Netanyahu and Kim Jong Un. 


In the absence of compassion, their psyches increasingly revolve around themselves alone, as the ever-expanding delusion regarding their own importance in the grand scheme of things takes hold. The effects of such extreme narcissism invariably manifest along the same lines as those of the playground bully, yet as with the bully, the venom that these tyrants perpetually exude conceals a deeply entrenched inferiority complex and an innate cowardice. It is this cowardice, coupled with an habitual egocentric desire to court popularity at any cost, that will, as you have so correctly put it, cause them to do ANYTHING regardless of all ethical considerations to promote themselves; compassion, in all cases, is the last thing on their minds. 


What truly mystifies me is how any human demographic can be so utterly blind to these basic insights as to allow itself to be deceived en masse by such entities; and to compound the matter, the abnormal dynamic of the current US elections is entirely unprecedented, barring what should have been lessons learned in both 2016 and 2020.

You haven’t really been clear about it, but what I gather you’re talking about is the strategy of some Democratic voters of switching their party affiliation so they can vote for the most extreme Republican in the RNC primaries? Is that what you’re trying to talk about?

The basic premise here is that if the RNC is stupid enough to nominate insane primary candidates who have no chance in the general election, the DNC can exploit that mistake by supporting the extreme candidates, knowing that the extremist will lose in the general.

It’s pretty much win-win for everyone this way: you help keep extremists out of office so that more progressive candidates have a chance to impact policy.

The main thing to remember is that it is the RNC’s own fault for nominating and voting for extremists in the first place. The RNC could easily avoid this trap by simply not nominating insane candidates.

lskdeak,"For much of modern history, there has been more or less  a gentlemen’s agreement to not assassinate each other’s head of state due to the problems it would cause, namely inviting retaliatory assassinations. Of course, countries have tried it (e.g. the US with Castro), but the calculus is that it usually isn’t worth the instability and escalation with nations that have modern military capabilities. Heads of state are also much more secure than the leaders of an insurgent organization, making assassination far more difficult even when a desirable option. The same goes for generals ever since warfare has evolved beyond them commanding at the front lines. It’s simply not feasible for even the most resourceful intelligence agencies to conduct the level of covert operations needed to eliminate a meaningful amount of an enemy nation’s military chain of command.

On the other hand, several drug cartels were rendered defunct, splintered, or a shadow of themselves after they lost most of their leadership in a short span of time, a much more feasible task given that they are criminal organizations with significantly less resources than the nations hunting them. The Beltrán-Leyva and Guadalajara cartels lost virtually all of their key leadership within the span of a couple years and effectively ceased to exist. Los Zetas were once among the top players in the game, but fragmentations in its organizational structure after it split from the Gulf Cartel as well as the killings/arrests of all of their founding members and up-and-coming second generation leadership have reduced them to a shell of their former glory. Other cartels like La Familia Michoacana and the Knights Templar centralized too much power among one or two leaders, leading to their collapse when their leaders were eliminated. The big players currently such as the Sinaloa and CJNG cartels have since structured themselves to become more resilient against losses of high ranking leadership, though at the greater risk of creating too many factions within their own organization.

lseq2je,"Obviously finding news agencies isn't a possible fix. Furthermore, Fox News is not somehow speaking to 56% of Americans. This problem is much larger than one media outlet. 

Rather, I think the problem might be more simple: President Trump spent every moment of his tenure talking about how he has the greatest economy ever. And then he spends every moment of his candidacy talking about how we have the worst economy ever. Compare this to how Obama talked about the economy during his own presidency, or how Biden talks about the economy now. Democrats are so very afraid of stepping on the toes of people who are hurting. And so essentially, everything Trump says goes unchallenged.

I know much of what Democrats dislike about Trump is his shamelessness. But to some extent, Democrats should also be bold in talking about their own policies, in talking about their own successes. Especially in today's political climate, it seems like no one gets any credit for showing sensitivity to hurting people. They get the most credit for *taking* the most credit.

lsf2rix,"In August 2024, inflation amounted to 2.5 percent, while wages grew by 4.6 percent. The inflation rate has not exceeded the rate of wage growth since January 2023. 

(Source: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1351276/wage-growth-vs-inflation-us/)

Despite wages outpacing inflation AND in spite of roughly four-in-ten Americans (41%) rating their own finances positively, fewer than a quarter of Americans (23%) rate the country’s economic conditions as excellent or good. Just one-in-ten Republican voters rate economic conditions as excellent or good. 

(Source: https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/05/23/views-of-the-nations-economy-may-2024/)

When polled, Americans don't attribute their raises to inflation but instead job performance or career progression, especially if they switched jobs during an inflationary period. Americans also tend to believe that employers have substantial discretion in setting wages rather than being subject to market forces, so if they're not getting a raise they blame corporate greed. 

(Source: https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-do-americans-think-about-inflation/)


I don't think Americans are dumb, but I do think:

1. Partisanship is obviously coloring people's perspectives of the economy because 90% Republicans refuse to say the economy is good despite 40% of them doing well financially.

2. People fantasize about the past and I do not believe Americans are doing the math on the relative cost of a burger today vs 2020 because if they did they wouldn't have as negative an opinion as they do.

3. There is a human tendency to give yourself too much credit for wage increases (I earned my 4.6% raise!!) and too much blame on government and businesses for inflation (raising prices by 2.5% was greedy!!) when both are due to market forces more than anything.",2024-10-17 13:25:16,13,PoliticalDiscussion,True,1

1 - opposition party needs to have ready a platform they can run on for when the election is called
2 - elections can be called at any time, but have to occur once every 5 years (in the British model you cite)
3 - the party selects its leader without the lengthy primary process - in other words, one has to be an active party member to have a say in the party leadership, not just any joe schmo who ""registers"" as a party member
4 - as the opposition needs to be ready at any time, they also need to maintain a shadow cabinet who can form the new government should they win
5 - party leader and cabinet must win their local seat to be part of the government - if the party leader can't win their seat, party needs to select another leader. This works in Parliamentary systems, the US is different.

Overall, the US system needs an overhaul that needs to start with voting reform that encourages greater participation, diminishes gerrymandering, and puts in place a system like ranked choice voting. This will help diminish the impact of political extremes and ensure party in power has policies more closely aligned with the true desires of the public, which will give them a more clear mandate to address the more tricky government reforms.

If you haven't heard Joe Biden parrot this idea--and eschew actual progressive policy--on CSPAN, you probably don't know that ""the green economy"" is simply him sticking to this conservative plan of 2005.

I was always aware that racism is a problem in our country. What I didn't realize, though, was the extent to which it shaped our politics for my entire lifetime.

But if you go digging into the data for the polls, most have a few problems. The recent times Florida poll that had Trump up by 15 also had him winning 18-29 by 13 points for example. Polls are also notoriously bad at predicting turnout, both total and demographical, as seen with the 2022 senate elections or the presidential election in 2016.

Bottom line, these are not ordinary times.  There is nothing at all about this process that isn't under attack.  I personally believe many foreign powers are engaged in our social media and messaging.

I was also hoping that the undeniable superiority of one candidate over the other, combined with the continuing failure of that other candidate to even achieve coherence, would have created a nice polling space from which to get a breather.  When that didn't happen, after the debate debacle, I just hardened.

There are a few facts that help me sleep at least a little.

1.  The pollster's probability of modeling the electorate accurately in 2024 is less likely than it was in '16,'18'20' and '22.  And they BLEW it in each of those cycles.  So, I've been watching the polls for trends, and a couple recently look flat, or a bit worse, but that is after a CONSTANT, if variable in rate, growth by the democratic ticket.  But if you can tell me how pollsters are reaching voters under 35, I'll try to believe you.  They're uncountable, imo.

2.  The disparity between the senate candidates and the top of the ticket makes no sense.   Granted the GOP has once again fielded a bunch of turd candidates, many of whom don't live in the states in which they are running.  Still, I don't think anyone believes there are 8% of AZ voters who will vote Trump/Gallego... So, there's that.

3.  Finally, open your eyes outside the media bubble.  She's raised almost twice the money he has, She has 4 times the number of volunteers he has.  His electorate is FIXED.  It is what it is.  Hers is potentially limitless...The turnout in '08 blew the pundit's minds, even though there were hints....

lrg6x7q,"I’m also curious what exactly they’ve done wrong? 

Some other things to call out that they’ve done right:
* Revolutionized digital and social media campaigning - to reach both young voters, new voters, and voters not tuned into legacy media. They are quite literally the next iteration of Bernie and AOC’s digital campaigning game. It is next level, fast, and much of it is relatable, human, and going viral.
* Hitting all levels of the media circuit: balancing legacy media (but not as much) with high volume channels and mediums to reach disengaged and new voters. Kamala has a lock on those super tuned into politics who don’t want Trump. And she’s not going to peal away his diehard base. Her campaign is focused on new voter turnout, including women, and youth. 
* Multiple stops in swing states, and not just big city centers: she corrected Hillary’s mistake in 2016 (actually a couple of those including debate approach, not calling half the country deplorable, but this is the biggest one). 
* Campaign messaging: the entire campaign is about bringing the country together. Being a leader for everyone (especially the middle class/working class).

>Just an aside Trump’s message has never changed since 2015, it’s all doom and gloom and only HE can fix it. It’s hate and fear mongering, and while that can work as a populist approach, there are many in this country that are tired of it. We’re tired in general.

Trump has never so much as hinted at an actual point to his crusade, except for 'get power, avoid jail'. There's no politics except for the cookie-cutter fascism-lite that comes naturally to anyone too stupid to understand why the country is falling apart. He's never been actually enthusiastic about a single thing that happens inside the capitol building, he's only ever been interested in being a king and being able to control everything.

lr45vmm,"Good response, although I don't fully agree. Point #1 is spot on, but I disagree on Point #2, which impacts how long Point #1 holds.


You're absolutely right in how you lay out the mindset and devotion of the MAGA base. But I think you're underestimating one important point:


Trump's *charisma.*


Donald Trump may be an aging, narcissistic, misogynistic, criminal, pathological liar. He may even be something of a fool at times. But he is not stupid when it comes to PR, branding, and messaging.


*Trump is uniquely excellent at branding himself and working a crowd.*


It's his biggest asset. He knows how make populist appeals to the masses, and he has the charisma to tell entertaining lies often enough that many believe that he's telling the truth.


He's definitely losing some of his luster as his age starts to catch up to him, but he is VERY good at speaking and working crowds, as well as controlling the narrative - even if he does so by constantly lying.


*I just don't see the MAGA movement lasting long without that figure and voice to consistently rally around.*


You can't just swap Trump out for some other guy and expect the MAGA train to keep rolling forward - at least not in its current state, size, or enthusiasm. Most MAGA affiliated down ballot candidates (governors, senators, etc) do *terrible* at the ballot. From Ron DeSantis to Kari Lake you can't just adopt Trump's messaging, *without Trump's voice,* and expect to win. On the contrary: they lose. Consistently. Just look at 2022.


I don't see other potential MAGA cult leaders picking up where Trump left off in a way that appeals to a wide enough portion of his base to keep the movement alive as THE dominant Republican force. Because the only thing that Republicans hate more than progress is losing. And Trump surrogates have a proven track record of losing. Because they may be MAGA, *but they aren't Trump.*


You capture the MAGA voter mindset well, though, and I'm curious just as to where they will steer themselves once Trump fades. I agree that they won't admit that they were ever wrong, but I'm betting that a lot of them will go back to be as politically inactive as they were prior to 2016.",2024-10-09 05:32:10,11,PoliticalDiscussion,True,1

lvdowl3,"Ellen: I think it really depends on what kind of an event it is that we’re fact-checking. 

Our reporters listen to *a lot* of speeches and interviews by the candidates, and they get very familiar with their stump speeches. When it comes to a major rally, we’ve usually heard and fact-checked whatever a candidate is repeating, so we’re listening for anything new or newsworthy.

For live fact-checking a debate, it’s a similar process, but we spend a lot of time before hand prepping things we suspect the candidates might say. (Not to brag, but our team doc to prep for the Trump-Harris debate was 100+ pages long.) One group on our team works on immediately sharing what we have prepped on social media or [our live blog,](https://www.politifact.com/article/2024/sep/10/presidential-debate-live-fact-check-harris-trump/) while another group starts working on new claims that come up so we can get a [fact-check](https://www.politifact.com/article/2024/sep/11/2024-presidential-debate-fact-check-harris-trump/) out quickly. 

And then there’s big breaking news events, like the Baltimore bridge collapse or the Trump assassination attempt in July or Hurricane Helene or Election Day, where we can’t really prepare. Breaking news can create an information gap as everyone is scrambling to get answers, and social media loves to fill that gap with misinformation. 

In these cases, we’re often in triage mode, trying to address the most serious, harmful or prevalent misinformation spreading online. That includes things like false claims about [FEMA aid](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/06/tweets/fema-gives-750-to-help-hurricane-victims-with-supp/) might dissuade survivors from getting help or disinformation that [discourages people from voting](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/nov/03/tweets/this-video-about-ballot-fraud-is-not-from-the-fbi/). It can be difficult since there might not be a ton of information available at the moment; For example, we waited to publish fact-checks about the shooter who attempted to assassinate Trump until his identity was confirmed by authorities.

Stepping back to a big picture, as far as a trend, there has been a resurgence of portraying queer people as child predators: This is true for Republican lawmakers in Congress and statehouse which makes it more mainstream. [This has had an impact on bookbanning and DEI instruction](https://19thnews.org/2024/07/book-bans-students-parents-advocates/), as our partners at the 19th\* have found.

Trump lost both the popular vote and the Electoral College to Joe Biden in 2020. (Once again the electoral vote was 306 to 232, but this time in the Democrat's favor.)

> For the movement among Black voters to matter, it must mean a net loss for Harris and a net gain for Trump. When we compare Black voters only to themselves, and no other group, it creates the appearance that this is the case. When we change the comparison to all voting blocs, the picture changes.

That is not what he says

Trump recently again pointed to what Eisenhower did - ""Operation Weback"".  That has nothing to do with criminal records (and also realize, by definition, illegals will have 'criminal records' by being in the US illegally.  For this conversation I will assume you are talking about actual criminal records).  It has to do with catching whatever illegals, putting them on ships and planes, and 'returning them'.  It lasted one year under Eisenhower, returned one million people including mistakenly rounding up American citizens.  

JD Vance has re-enforced this by telling the NYT recently he thinks it is 'reasonable' to deport around a million a year.  (Which was of course far different then what he said in 2012).

First and foremost, I'd like to thank all **300** of you who entered a prediction over the past week. I know the form was a bit long, so I appreciate those who took the time to fill it out. Future contests will hopefully be a bit quicker to work through.

With that said, here are some interesting facts about our predictions:

* A majority of entrants believe that the Democrats will take the House (83%) and Senate (55%)

* The closest House race is AZ-06, where challenger Kirsten Engel wins over Rep. Ciscomani (158-142)

* A vast majority of entrants believe Vice President Kamala Harris will be the next President (90%)

* Of those who believe Harris will win, the average EV number is 308; the most common is 319.

* Of those who believe Trump will win, the average EV number is 310; the most common is 312.

* Entrants barely believe that South Dakota will pass its abortion-related ballot measure (151-149)

* The most common expectation for the number of states with a margin of victory under 1% is **three**.

* The top 3 expected states with the closest margin of victory are North Carolina (31%), Arizona (21.3%), and Georgia (13.7%).

If there are any other questions about what our entrants predicted, feel free to reply to this comment and I'll attempt to answer them!

Major analyses of these undervotes show that Bush would have still taken the state by around 400 votes.

Gore won Florida on a statewide recount, which would have been too cost prohibitive and time intensive to perform under the circumstances, was not requested by Gore's legal team, was not ordered as a remedy by the Florida SC, and was not an option under any circumstance in 2000 when the election was called for Bush.

I really enjoy your podcast with Sammy and appreciate you doing this AMA. I fully believe in the 13 keys and look forward to your prediction being correct again this year.  


I'm sure you are familiar with Aaru but for those who are not, I've added some information and article link below.  


Do you have any thoughts on their belief that  ""No traditional poll will exist by the time the next general election occurs,” Fink said in an interview with Semafor. “There are massive issues when you’re using real people. You never know if someone is telling the truth.”  


More on Aaru: ""For election results, Aaru uses census data to replicate voter districts, creating AI agents essentially programmed to think like the voters they are copying. Each agent is given hundreds of personality traits, from their aspirations to their family relationships. The agents are constantly surfing the internet and gathering information meant to mimic the media diets of the humans they’re replicating, which sometimes causes them to change their voting preferences.  


Congratulations on qualifying for the Senior Olympics next year by the way. My dad competed in Masters T&F so and I have fond memories of the events.

ls8l2jf,"There are at least four things. The first is control of local governments. While Al leans republican the black belt leans democratic, voter suppression gives the republicans control in some communities near the black belt. The second is maintaining a super majority in the state House and Senate. The third is the makeup of Al delegation in the house. The fourth is it is a habit. If you've been doing something for around 150 years, it's hard to break the habit.

If we average the White and Black populations in AL the political leaning is roughly 55% republican, 10% neutral, and 35% democratic. However the white population leans republican (70%), but the black population more heavily leans democratic (80%).

The make up AL senate is 77% republican, 23% democratic, the AL house is 72% and 28%, and the 6/7 (86%) of Al representatives in the US house are republicans. These all skew heavily republican compared to the political leaning of the population. The difference in the state legislative bodies give the republicans a super majority in both the house and senate. Both bodies require 60% to pass constitutional admentends* and the senate has a history of a filibuster. The skewing of the US house representation, combined with other southern states, impacts the control of the house. 

Additionally, in statewide elections AL elected Doug Jones to the senate in 2018. This shows that Al can elect democrats if the republican is too crazy. Voter suppression pushes the line determining how crazy is too crazy to the right.

1. Driving is a privilege, not a compulsion. You are not required to have a drivers licence, and are not compelled to get one. However, if you use public roads, only then are you required to get that license.

2. Paying Taxes and being compelled to speak in court are both powers that are in the states interest for maintaining a balanced and functional government. 

I think the distinction is relevant because of the consequences:

People don't need licenses? Chaos and crashes on public roads. 

Don't have to pay taxes? The government can't be funded. 

Free to refuse to testify? The government loses the ability to enforce Laws. 

In comparison, if you are not required to vote, the result is that the only people whose voices are heard, are people who want their voices to be heard. 

That's the ideal, of course. 

There are about 4 types of people currently not voting: 

1. People that would vote if they could, but can't get off work, or are being removed from voter roles, or any other voter suppression issues.
2. People that legally can't because they are felons, even though they've served their time.
3. People that aren't voting as a protest.
4. People that don't care enough to vote. 

Mandating voting leaves Felons locked out, but technically fixes the others. But it's a bandaid. 

If we implement reforms, restore the right to vote of Felons, make election day a national holiday, guarantee access to a polling place, implement automatic voter registration, and any other great legislation we could pass, we reduce that group to only two groups:

1. People that aren't voting as a protest.
2. People that don't care enough to vote.

lqz8vwq,"Here is how I have come to understand Trump's enduring steadfast appeal. He has an absolute unique ability among politicians to dominate the national discourse. The end result of that is that now Conservative grievances get WAY more attention than Liberal ones. 

Look at the conversations that were happening in the news before / after Trump. 

We went from Me Too to Cancel Culture.  
We went from the Black Lives Matter protests to protesting against DEI programs  
We went from discussing increasing minority representation in college to ending affirmative action  
We went from talking about comprehensive immigration reform to a wildly conservative bill being killed as being too liberal   

If you turn on any news channel randomly today, you are likely to hear a conversation that Conservatives want to be having. 

That is what the Average Joe cares about it seems. They had built up a resentment over their belief that the media (which they see as a proxy for the overall culture) only cared about Liberal grievances.

On that, you and I simply disagree. I WILL outright dismiss it *as a reliable source*. Sure, a broken clock is correct twice a day and many of their articles hold truth, but an unbiased source, from the ruler of Qatar, when the balance of the middle east rests partly on this election? Hell no. 

The OP didn't ask 'what are some sources that aren't totally trustworthy but that I'll be able to spend time countering with other sources until I uncover the buried truth?' I think they want to do as little reading as possible. 

I just don't see the value in the exercise you propose, and it is definitely not what OP was asking for. OP is not trying to bolster their own argument and counter others. They simply want some fair info, quickly, easily. 

I also did not say to ignore al jazeera. We all encounter AJ articles all the time. But is it what OP was looking for - an unbiased source? No.

I believe that, despite the subsidies from government grants dedicated to the arts, NPR is not 'owned' by the US government and does not take direction from it, like AJ does. I do not believe NPR is a voice of the current American administration which is how it would be if it was controlled by the federal government. I do not think NPR'S relationship to the American government is the equivalent of AJ's to the Qatari, despite funding from the national broadcasting act.

I don't know how to do the quote thing, but you said that I don't extend the same criticism of bias to the pro-israel papers like NYT and WaPo. I'll just take this opportunity to say that I think NYT, CNN and WaPo are biased and I don't recommend them as an individual, one-stop shop for unbiased election info for someone who wants quick answers. Get that cleared up there. However, they are still not equivalent. I do not know that Jeff bezos arms the IDF. They are biased for other reasons I guess. 

But you included NPR and called them pro-zionist. If you mean they are pro Israel-existing-as-a-country, I can not argue that, as only a monster would argue for the eradication of an entire country.

lutykm7,"Some bad news. Marist polls dropped which pulled Trump's average down badly in the rust belt. Marist looks like they were a few points off the mark in 2020, but the Trump-mentum in the polls has definitely stalled out in this last week, at least in the northern region. Michigan is sinking further underwater quickly, Wisconsin is down again, and PA is now just barely a fractional win for Trump.

Allan Lichtman is gloating that his prediction of a Harris win is going to be right because the female vote is so heavily lopsided in the early vote. He's not wrong about the vote. Many swing states have a 10 point higher vote among women. The split of men/women are almost identical to what they were in 2020 swing states, which didn't help Trump then. And some polls in recent weeks have shown women are equally as skewed to Harris as men are to Trump. With an equal skew on either side, women voting in bigger numbers just mathematically means a Harris win. The numbers I looked at earlier show women are not so big on Harris in Georgia, but there's about an equal skew in the rust belt trio and in North Carolina.

I think Trump peaked too early. He got momentum like two weeks ago, but expecting that to sustain for three full weeks was a tall order.

Megyn Kelly had the Emerson polling guy on yesterday, who gave a pretty good analysis. He said he still thinks there may be a ""shy Trump"" vote in the polls. And he's not convinced there's any hidden Harris vote. He thinks Michigan is Harris' strongest state. And he said what I've said in recent weeks, that Wisconsin is notoriously underpolled for Trump, it's always been his strongest rust belt state, and he expects it's the one where Trump has the best chances in this year. He said, in their polling, the white male Wisconsin voters just seem to lie about not supporting Trump in their polls even when they do. The Emerson guy definitely thought North Carolina was locked up for Trump, and understood why Harris was cutting ad spending.

Trump's first 2016 election cycle sufficiently motivated portions of the population that were not active participants in the political process prior to his candidacy.

We needed to get out of COVID and the federal reserve needed to print money to do so, they made solid choices based off what was happening. the wars going on in the world is not helping, Instability is bad look. But those two issues should have Trump ahead 10 points nationally and 15 points in the swing states, its a dead heat because he's a terrible candidate.

This is an election where every vote counts, and arguments about Trump being ineffective, and how Harris will cut taxes, provide home purchase assistance, small business, and ABORTION ABORITION, call him out on the hypocrisy, selecting those judges to over turn Roe was a right wings first step towards total abortion ban, dont need to debate him call him out in the interviews call him out directly keep asking him if he will veto a total abortion law or a 6 week abortion law. overturning Roe only put women at risk in deep red states, upholding Roe protected them, because conversative states already had strict abortion laws on the books.

Stop talking about Project 2025, ask trump directly if he will support removing the filibuster BECUASE HE WILL if Republicans control congress, get him on the record, people will connect the dots themselves

Enough with Trump threat to Democracy everybody knows this already, just start talking about how Harris will be diffrent from Biden and the plans you want to pass.

As far as invoking the 25th, that might happen with Trump. But Kamala has so far not shown any hint of cognitive decline. 

Even if she *somehow* did and was removed from office via the 25th amendment, Walz has some military experience, albeit no combat experience. Trump by contrast, has nothing resembling such experience, and of the two current candidates is far more likely to be 25thed out of office.

I've seen a lot of ideas on this post that seem unlikely, but this absolutely takes the cake.

Edit: Actually, the 25th amendment *also* has a section where it describes how a VP can be appointed that requires the consent of both houses of congress. If we have a Harris presidency, the idea of *both* houses having a republican majority are so low as to be laughable.

lvcorvb,"I wish I shared your optimism. I don't disagree with your analysis, but I have too much Trump trauma to accept the hopium dose. My one hesitancy about making inferences is that PA, WI, and MI don't have restrictive abortion bans. IA does. Ohio and Kansas are pretty good about abortions, so those other polls you pointed out are definitely hopeful signs. The Selzer poll is *good* for Harris, but it shifted for her because of independent women who are (probably) motivated by abortion. It's tempting to assume independent women will behave the same way across the Midwest, but abortion could potentially be *slightly* less of a motivating factor in states that don't have bans. In many Midwestern states, there is also the split ticket option to vote for Trump and Democrats down ballot to protect abortion rights. Iowans don't really have that option. It's rare for voters to split tickets these days, but it can happen enough to sway the election. 

That said, there are no useful polls coming out of Wisconsin. The lack of outlier polls there is statistically improbable, suggesting herding. There's not a lot that can be learned from those polls (outside of digging into the cross tabs, which all agree that Harris is doing well with women, though it's hard to guage how many of them are likely voters), so the next best thing we have is the Selzer result, which obviously looks really bad for Trump. If the Harris campaign can make the case that abortion bans are bad for the entire nation, then Selzer's Iowa results are obviously transferable to other states. It's an easier case to make in a place like Iowa, but voters across the entire country are persuadable. 

The other gold standard poll (from NYT/Sienna) isn't as rosy for Harris in the Midwest, but they are good for her in the sun belt. People are arguing that they oversampled rural voters. I'll be honest; I haven't dug into the cross tabs yet, so I couldn't say if it's just a hopium dose or if rural voters really were oversampled. 

Either way, the Selzer poll is just one of many. It's the best one. However, even the best polls that take the biggest and most accurate samples *should* be wrong in roughly 5% of cases (assuming they all use the same methodology, reach enough people to use a 95% confidence interval, and publish a high enough volume of results). I don't personally think this one is wrong by more than 4 or 5 points. I just can't be sure. I'm also not sure if independent women from Iowa tell us everything that we need to know about how the votes will shake in the other Midwestern states. Selzer suggested the possibility of a Harris landslide, and a few other polls (that clearly aren't herding) from Kansas and Ohio offer more good evidence in favor of Harris. A landslide was always possible, but now it feels even more likely. I just don't want to get my hopes up because this optimistic interpretation of the Selzer poll does come with a few small caveats.

Anyway, since people have been burned before by hating on Selzer, I'm not going to be the one to do it. She's probably, to some degree, correct about a surge toward Harris. Only time will tell how widespread and significant that surge is.",2024-11-03 21:33:46,1,PoliticalDiscussion,True,-1

lvggbtr,"Yeah, a little. Historically, the vp pick helps marginally in the presidential race, and the presidential race helps relatively substantially with down ballot races. Ohio might be something like +9 in favor of Trump when it'd otherwise have been R+8 without Vance. (Idk if these will be the final results. R+8 is the 2020 result; that's why i chose these numbers. Im not trying to make an actual prediction here.) If Trump wins Ohio by 9, then Sherrod Brown has to hope for *a lot* of split ticketing in order to win. Split ticketing is rare in today's climate, but it does happen. Since the senate race is polling so tightly relative to the presidential race in ohio, we know that split ticketing is probably going to happen, and Brown just has to hope that it's enough to put him over the edge. Technically R+9 is higher hill to climb for Brown than R+8, but it's not nothing when the race seems to be so close. At the end of the day, if it really does end up coming down to a single point or so against Brown (which is totally possible), we can say that Vance may have made a difference.

Having said that, I think you are falling prey to the right wing misinformation campaign on some of these points.  And i'm not saying that dems don't put their own spin on things, but the difference is still night and day as far as outright lies go.

Republicans are anti war only when it suits their current needs, generally that means when they are not the party in office.  The cry ""war hawk"" every time the dems are in office and then when you look back in history, it is them who have ballooned the deficit every single term with foreign engagements and military spending.  It's all right there on paper, you just have to get off the misinformation diet and go find it.  GOP generally always wants to increase military spending more than democrats and criticized biden for not spendung enough at points.

I agree Kamala and the democrats (barring bernie) are absolutely terrible at communicating details during speeches and debates but they are still miles ahead of Trumps stream of outright lies. You can look up what was in the immigration/border bill the republicans didnt pass.  The point is moot anyway because if anyone truly wanted to crack down on illegal immigration hard, they would target businesses who employ them with severe consequences.  None of the powers that be do that because they know it's extremely useful to have a plethora of cheap laborers and doing so would shit all over the economy.  Trump doesn't care at all about immigrants, he mareied several and emplpys 1000s. 
 It's 100% an act to create outrage and dupe people into voting for him.  It's his burning reichstag, just a manufactured crisis he can claim to be able to fix.  Moreover... he ran on the same thing last time and almost no progress on his wall (because he doesnt actually want to do that).

luzn8pe,"IMO, foreign-controlled apps (like TikTok, or any new app) shouldn’t be allowed to have political content. It makes us too vulnerable to foreign interference. 

The content you described that’s “meant to appeal to a certain demographic” (low-info women voters who don’t understand Dobbs) has made me very uncomfortable in this election cycle. FTR I’m a registered Dem & pro choice, but the fearmongering propaganda & outright deception is wrong & will ultimately harm the party. Harris can’t “codify Roe” & there’s no risk Trump will “ban abortion & birth control & track women’s periods,” either. Abortions have increased post-Dobbs largely due to the abortion pills now being distributed widely without proper medical oversight. But regardless, no POTUS can federalize abortion now that SCOTUS ruled it’s a matter of state law. Healthcare is regulated at the state level, except drugs/ devices which get federal approval. 

I’m concerned women will feel deceived & disappointed & it’ll do longterm damage to our party. 
In states where repro rights are an issue, we should be encouraging people to take STATE action & help them to do so. We should fund non-profits to facilitate this, too. 

If a Dem POTUS could “codify Roe,” obviously they would’ve done it already. But they can’t. Without socialized healthcare, it’s impossible to make ANY procedure a “fundamental right” because it involves a third-party provider performing a procedure. You can’t force doctors & hospitals to perform it, & what about people who can’t afford it? We can’t put government-funded abortion clinics in every jurisdiction in the country before we offer basic healthcare to all citizens. 

Surely, we can all agree that the right to stay alive & healthy is more basic than the right to abortion. But healthcare isn’t a hot-button issue that manipulates, so it’s not being used as propaganda to win an election. Clearly DNC leadership believes “the end justifies the means” but I really don’t agree.

luc9dr5,"Semi Presidential systems have a President and a Prime Minister with almost always the Prime Minister handling domestic policy and being appointed by the Parliament or Congress. The President in these systems are elected by the people and handle foreign policy and head the executive government. 

That is ideal to me. It makes it hard for dictatorship by 1 leader to emerge and keeps continuity of power in foreign affairs for the duration of a Presidential term. It also creates stability and holds the Parliament more accountable for economic and domestic issues instead of them attempting to blame it on the President and it empowers the Parliament to have more ways to remove the President.

France, Ukraine, Poland, Russia, Lithuania, Romania de-facto Serbia and many more nations have this system. 

France's way is arguably the best of this with more checks and balances for the fact that if the President is removed or dies in office he/she is replaced by the Senate leader who has only acting powers until elections are held. This then makes it way more difficult for a Prime Minister and his cabinet to launch a coup against the President because their man the Prime Minister wont become Acting President which can have some powers until election. 

Putin for instance was first a Prime Minister then when Yeltsin was pressured to resign Putin became Acting President for 3 months before new elections were mandated to happen within 90 days. In those months he had a lot of power and then won the election.

And on that note. Putin while running an authortarian government had a longer road to total power than say Trump would need if he or let us ever say someone smarter but more dangerous than him were to be elected President of the United States. Why do I say that? because Fully Presidential Systems which only the US and most nations in Latin America do give insane degrees of autonomy and power to the President. Only in Brazil and like Chile do the Courts act as a safe guard to prevent total dictatorships. Putin when he first became President did not have absolute power and never got that till about his 2nd term and for sure during his 3rd term. Putin had powerful allies he made and then he even had to surrender the Presidency to Medvedev but it worked out because Medvedev was pro Putin and had the same ideas of how to run Russia.

My point is authortarian government in Russia factually requires more of a mass popular movement and a majority of the Government Congress members. Case in point 2 former Russian Prime Ministers under Putin turned against him and 1 of them still speaks out against him. They were all under his 1st or 2nd term.

Trump as President legally speaking has an easier route to becoming a total autocrat he is only hindered by term limits via the Constitution and how hard that is to change and how hard it is for either side to win a strong enough majority to change the laws. However, the position of US President gives the President absolute power on law enforcement and military means so coup becomes easier.

However, to answer your question in a Semi Presidential system I believe the Prime Minister should be popular among the elected officials who majority select him/her. The President should be a populist since they are elected by mass popular vote. The reason the PM should not also by a populist is because it may yield cult following usurping of power. 


With regards to full Parlimentary systems they are the worst in my opinion as far as Democratic effiiency can go. A Presidential system with a weak President term limit or limits and strong judiciarcy and legislature is better if you ask me. However, it depends on how the vote is counted. In a country like Spain coalition governments are often needed thereby reducing the power of the Prime Minister who almost always is from the ruling party. Israel is another example were the Prime Minister party always has a plurality usually but never an absolute majority thus needs coalition partners.",2024-10-29 11:40:28,2,PoliticalDiscussion,True,1

They don't have to be three different candidates. There is no point in the process that the Duma can insist on their own candidate if the president's choice fails. The president can unilaterally sack a prime minister and I believe dismiss a minister as well. They can veto a law and require 2/3 to override, and their term limit, until 2020, was two consecutive terms, not absolute. They name the judges, set military policy, they serve 6 year terms ever since 2012. They can make decrees so long as it is not against the law or constitution as opposed to just issuing regulations where laws authorize them. In a system of government with such weak democracy to begin with, it was very vulnerable to autocratic capture to begin with and had an unduly powerful president on top of it since 1993.

But the day of the election does have to be set by the National Congress.

I would say, given the definition of propaganda, Fox News is definitely way more of a candidate for that label.

And your comments on Trump - I am sorry, but do you think he should get away with this crimes? He has been convicted by a jury of his peers. Let’s break it down, and another poster did this already so copying from that person:

1. Trump has admitted to having no plan.
2. Trump is a convicted felon. A law breaker does *not* uphold the law, and logically, should not be trusted to uphold it.
3. Trump purposefully had his own elected officials shoot down a bi-partisan border bill, for the sole purpose of maintaining a TALKING POINT.
4. Trump added $8.4 TRILLION to the deficit.
5. Trump added more to the deficit than ANY OTHER PRESIDENT IN HISTORY, aside from Obama. In a single term. Obama outpaced him by slightly over a trillion, meaning Trump nearly raked in as much debt in *one term* as Obama did in two.
6. He is a pathological liar, incapable of keeping any of his campaign promises. He lied about the wall. Lied about helping the average American, and passed tax cuts solely for the wealthy. Lied about a health care plan. How could anyone LOGICALLY believe he’s going to do any of the things he claims, when he had 4 years to do *something* other than golf??
7. He retained classified documents, in his private estate, without proper clearance, and refused to return them. This could be all sorts of security breaches, we, the public, don’t have a fucking *clue* about. Logically speaking, someone who STEALS GOVERNMENT PROPERTY, even if it isn’t highly classified information, should not be in any government office, where they’ll have a chance to do it again.
8. He tried to forcibly overthrow a fair and democratic election. If he is incapable of accepting the results of our democratic process, then he should not even be allowed to run for president. Point blank. If you are running for any office which uses a democratic process, then you should be willing/able to accept the results of that process. If you can’t, then you shouldn’t even be a nominee at that point, because that shows that you have no interest in what is best for the people, nor the peoples ideals.
9. It was discovered that Russian propaganda was purposefully targeting the Clinton campaign, to aid his run for presidency. It should go without saying that anyone with logic, or hell, basic common sense, should NOT want their ruler to be associated in any way shape or form, with a fascist dictator. Yet, these people vote for a man who is buddy buddy with one of the most oppressive dictators of this era.
10. Trump openly *mocks* his own supporters. How can you logically believe that a person who mocks you, a BULLY, could have anyone’s best interests in mind? Why would you willingly hire a bully, to look after the lives and well being of an entire country? There is no logic or reason to that.

It didn't even become a named variant until end of May and became globally dominant in June 2021.

He's repeatedly retweeted white genocide accounts many times:

>During the campaign Trump was found to have retweeted the main influencers of the #WhiteGenocide movement over 75 times, including twice that he retweeted a user with the handle @WhiteGenocideTM. - Wikipedia

Wikipedia on Trump using racial hygiene rhetoric at rallies:

>""Since fall 2023, Trump has repeatedly used racial hygiene rhetoric by stating that undocumented immigrants are ""poisoning the blood of our country"", which has been compared to language echoing that of white supremacists and Adolf Hitler. He has also claimed that immigrants who have committed crimes have ""bad genes""""

Wikipedia on his campaign:

>""As with his previous presidential campaigns, Trump's 2024 campaign has regularly espoused anti-immigrant nativist fearmongering, racial stereotypes, and dehumanized immigrants. In his rhetoric, Trump has blurred the distinction between legal and illegal immigrants, and has promised to deport both. Trump has repeatedly claimed that undocumented immigrants are subhuman, stating they are ""not people"", ""not humans"", and ""animals"". At rallies, Trump has stated that undocumented immigrants will ""rape, pillage, thieve, plunder and kill"" American citizens, that they are ""stone-cold killers"", ""monsters,"" ""vile animals"", ""savages"", and ""predators"" that will ""walk into your kitchen, they'll cut your throat"" and ""grab young girls and slice them up right in front of their parents"". Trump's dehumanizing anti-immigrant rhetoric regularly features details of young women allegedly killed by Hispanic male assailants while ignoring male victims. Studies find no evidence that immigrants commit crimes at higher rates than native-born Americans, and Trump has not provided any evidence to back up his claims.""

Recent Rally:

>“But I protect you from outside enemies. But you know I always say, we have the outside enemies, so you can say China, you can say Russia, you can say Kim Jong Un … if you have a smart president it’s no problem,” Trump said “It’s the enemy from within."" ""All the scum we have to deal with that hate our country,” “That’s a bigger enemy than China and Russia.… Everyday Americans like Cindy are living in fear all because Kamala Harris decided to empty the slums and prison cells of Caracas, and many other places. Happening all over the world.” “Every country, you know, prison populations all over the world are down. Crime all over the world is down. Because they take the world’s criminals, gang members, drug dealers, and they deposit them into the United States. Bus after bus after bus,” “They took the criminals out of Caracas, and they put them along your border, and they said if you ever come back, we’re going to kill you,” “Think of that!” he continued. “We have to live with these animals. But we won’t live with them for long!”

At that, one person in the crowd shouted, “Kill them!”

Also his base has gotten more extreme, because not only does the above stuff he says at rallies not turn them off but so does the stuff below:

Couple days ago Trump suggested his supporters would beat up people opposing him even if they're their own kids:

>Former President Donald Trump called for a protester at one of his rallies to “go back home to Mommy” to “get the hell knocked out of her,” [jump] ""Trump continued, imitating the imagined mother: “‘Was that you, darling?’ And she gets the hell knocked out of her.” “Her mother’s a big fan of ours,” the former president finished before returning to his speech. “Her mother, her father.” - [AP News on Trump's recent Coachella rally.](https://apnews.com/article/trump-election-protester-violence-california-d7d68895390b6b289d146b7377bc1c18)

>“We have two enemies. We have the outside enemy, and then we have the enemy from within. And the enemy from within, in my opinion, is more dangerous than China, Russia, and all those countries"". - Trump

Among his examples of enemies within were Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi, and the Radical Left which is a catch all term he uses for the left.

>“I think the bigger problem are the people from within. We have some very bad people. We have some sick people,” he said on Fox’s Sunday Morning Futures programme. “It should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by the national guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can’t let that happen.” - Trump

The main part of Project 2025 - Mass Partisan purges of the government is one of the main parts of Plan 47, Trumps official policy.  In addition General Milley, his own head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, came out and said last time he was in office he already had to stop him from doing political purges of military officers.

>The project asserts a controversial interpretation of the unitary executive theory, according to which the entire executive branch is under the complete control of the president. It proposes reclassifying tens of thousands of federal civil service workers as political appointees in order to replace them with people loyal to the president. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_2025)

The plan also calls for ending the semi-independence of federal agencies and putting them under direct control of the President. For instance, it would have Trump directing the DOJ who to prosecute.

They have him dead to rights on not only having the documents but directing his workers to move/hide them. The problem with her case was the documents were digital and had been erased. If she had physical documents and didn't return them it would've been a different story.

Also, maybe she intended to do something with them, maybe she was just an old grandma who knows shit about computers, but there's a reason Trump stole/kept classified documents and I suspect it relates to his 7 phone calls with Putin since leaving office.

The use of Super Delegates and eventually log rolling with Sanders secured Hillary the nomination. 

The fact that Kamala Harris burned through a load of cash in 2020 and dropped out before the first primary, should not be over looked. Harris has never one a single vote at the top if the ticket on the national stage. 

Neither one of these women were popular nationally. 

The leadership of the Democrat party long ago determined it was easier to manipulate voters than to listen to them. They are now reaping the matured rewards of that coarse with blacks, unions, and the victims of crimes as their interest has been with migrants, big businesses donors, and felons. 

Another factor to look at is that both of these candidates come from places popular with young Democrats, but not some much in fly over states. New York and San Fransisco are the homes of some of the nuttiest politics around. I am not saying that Georgia can't have a nutty congressperson here and there, but NY and SF are known for bag taxes, straw bans, drink size regulations, homelessness, crime, corruption, etc. These aren't thing that are popular outside of Universities where students are taught they are Mecca and Medina, requiring a pilgramage to in their lifetime.

IF Trump wins, we should look at **the numbers**, not simply that he won. Trump himself had 11 Million more people voted for him in 2020 than 2016, yet he lost.

Ir more than likely the increase came through an entire initiative through COVID on mail in ballots and other political reasons. So maybe it's best we *don't* be so reductionist. And we shouldn't even focus on those national totals, but the swing states.

In Wisconsin, 400,000 more people voted in 2020. And Biden actually had a LOWER MARGIN of Victory over Trump than Clinton.

In Pennsylvania, nearly 1,000,000 more people voted in 2020. And while Clinton lost by 45,000, Biden won by 80,000. (125,000 gain in Democrat partisan support)

In Michigan, nearly 900,000 more people voted in 2020. And while Trump won by 10,000, Biden won by 150,000. (160,000 gain in Democrat partisan support).

Now though, Trump has been normalized despite how much worse he actually got, esp after Jan 6. And people are still mostly ignorant and see Kamala as more left just bc she's a minority woman. She is trying to overcompensate for that wrong perception...also though, people see Biden's presidency as largely not great just bc of inflation and foreign conflict. 

They have no clue that the US has handled inflation and has a stronger economy than most the rest of the world, or that Biden has been really successful in Ukraine, and they are actually correct that he screwed some things up w Afghanistan and thr Border and maybe Israel/Gaza. 

That being said, Harris is: 

1) distancing herself from the negative perception of Biden's presidency 

2) distancing herself for peoples wrong perceptions of her as far left and

3) being herself. Harris is a moderate and a neoliberal. Her 2020 run was mostly placation of leftist voters at the time. People saw through it.

Black people could go everywhere white people could go, even your kids schools! Women could control their own fertility with the birth control pill and they could get their own credit cards–without their husbands! When there is social progress there is always, always a backlash. 

The backlash here is the modern Republican party. From Reagan forward they have been against any policy that might materially benefit average Americans (because now it included *them*). The NRA went from a gun safety outfit to a crazed gun rights lobbying group. Gotta keep a lot of guns around in case the government betrays us again. And American evangelicals suddenly developed strong feelings about abortion. Prior to this it was just the Catholics, a minority that the rest of the country could easily ignore. 

A few decades go by. Then suddenly there's a black family in the white house for eight years. Democrats were certain to put a woman in next, plus gays can get married now!

Along comes Donald Jerome Trump. His open racism and misogyny signaled to a lot of white Americans that here was someone who would finally fight back and preserve their precious way of life (where women and people of color knew their places). That is in fact what MAGA means.

But Trump lost his bid for reelection in 2020. He had even lost the popular vote in 2016, not the first time this has happened to a Republican presidential candidate. People on the right begin to recognize that their ideas aren't popular enough to reliably win the presidency.

During this interview he reflected on the feeling he had in the closing weeks of his campaign, addressing packed rallies and feeling the wave of support and commented that he remembered thinking, ""this doesn't feel like losing.""

This is easily the most cogent thing I've ever seen Trump communicate, but that is also neither here nor there.

Do packed rallies, not just for Harris but for her campaign surrogates across battleground states and a national address in DC attended by somewhere between 75,000 and 100,000 people feel like losing?

ChatGPT doesn't know ""the sky is blue"" -- it knows ""90% of training texts with 'the sky' included the words 'is blue' after, but 5% of training texts said 'is purple', so it outputs ""the sky is purple"" to the question ""what color is the sky"" every 20th time you ask it (this is not a literal example, I don't know how many times you have to ask it what color the sky is to get a confidently wrong answer from it these days).

If you trained it on a message board of science fiction writers, it might see 'the sky is purple' 25% of the time and 'the sky is green' 25% of the time. You'll then start getting ""the sky is purple"" or ""green"" when you ask it that question around 50% of the time. Chat GPT doesn't know it was getting input from some random sci-fi fiction forum or high level science textbook, and it generally doesn't care.

lul82v6,">I highly doubt he didn’t mean to call the voters themselves garbage. 

Of course you do, because that’s what you want to hear. And, of course, you’ll accuse me of the same.

>The pause in between, the fact that “his supporter’s his demonization” makes no sense

Biden has a stutter. He’s talked for years about conquering it. But clearly he’s not capable of controlling it anymore.

A stutter is basically getting stuck while you’re speaking. Either difficulty getting a word out or repeating the same word over again.

The “his-his-his” makes it obvious he’s in the middle of a stutter between “supporter’s” and “demonization”. He got stuck after “supporter’s” and is essentially trying to restart. Rephrasing is a strategy for people with a stutter to get around words they’re stuck on. Biden is stuck on “supporter’s demonization” and switching to “his demonization” to get around it, but he still trips over “his” multiple times before he can continue.

If Biden was focused on Trump’s supporters being garbage, I’d expect to hear a lot more “they’re” in the follow up comments. The fact he immediately follows “supporter’s/supporters” with “his [singular] demonization” tells me Biden’s focus and intent are on the comments made by the comedian and not Trump’s supporters as a whole.

Biden used to be able to mask his stutter. But he clearly can’t anymore. He’s been speaking like this for well over a year now.

ltyos9o,"A number of white, conservative men, have been staunchly pushing back against things like changing gender norms, women's independence, a more equitable society in general, and what they perceive as their own emasculation and marginalization, and the destruction of ""the nuclear family."" These same men have all but claimed that they ought to be a protected class.

But this isn't anything new. It's been going on for decades.

And look, I can concede that some men in this country have been feeling increasingly isolated, and have their own societal wide issues to contend with.

HOWEVER, for years, these men have been trying desperately to scapegoat women and women's rights movements, democrats, liberal social policies and the addressing of injustices.

There's, ironically of course, no responsibility in this. Because the hard truth is, what some of these men are feeling, is a result of a well-oiled, long standing patriarchal society pressuring them with and imposing certain expectations on them.

So this movement emerges around what is now called, the ""manosphere"", where some men start gravitating towards right wing voices and personalities like Jordan Peterson, and an extreme cases, people like Andrew Tate. 

As a result, these movements and public figures, whether they want to acknowledge it or not, end up encouraging or perpetuating harmful stereotypes, misogyny, harassment and abuse, radicalization, what some might call ""toxic masculinity,"" the undermining of gender equality and discrimination towards the LGBTQ community. While there are also links between some members of this movement and acts of violence. 

It is not a *""crisis of masculinity""* as much as it is a crisis of insecurity.

So what this all boils down to is the recognition that figures like Trump, who, conflictingly, represent the aggressive, ""alpha male"" archetype,  the strongman persona, the old school authority figure, while being a symbol of masculinity, naturally draw these men in.

But the irony of it all, is that Trump represents what they really are, because Trump is an incredibly insecure, shallow and fragile person. He's also a serial adulterer, misogynist, sexist, sexual abuser, innate child, and a WORLD class victim.

And all of these things, especially Trump's persecution complex, appeals to these men. 

What makes it worse, is that in the eyes of these same men, Kamala Harris represents that scapegoat. She is everything they despise. She is the symbol for their resentment and their grievances.

So demagogues *like* Donald Trump, JD Vance, even Elon Musk, play into this, and it's a fairly effective strategy. 

They can get away with blaming women, especially liberal women, Democrats, even Harris herself, for oppressing these aggrieved men, for dismantling traditional/regressive gender roles and family structures, for transforming society for the worse, for destroying ""the nuclear family,"" for *forcing* women to be more independent, for taking away men's privilege to be kings of their own domain, the authoritative, household breadwinner and dictator of the home and the workplace.

Sometimes it's even a matter of not having the privilege anymore to be abusive, or sexually harass coworkers, cheat on their spouses without consequence, or even having to be relegated to household chores duty, which is obviously so beneath them, but these are things they probably won't say out loud...

That being said, at the end of the day, what these men don't realize, is that their blame is misdirected. Again, maybe they should start with reflecting on how we got here. Maybe they should be thinking about how literally centuries of rigid, dogmatic, inequitable social structures and gender norms caused a lot of problems to begin with. 

After that, they should probably start directing that reflection inward, and realize that ""masculinity"" isn't defined by how tan your balls are, or how much testosterone you're injecting, or how confrontational and aggressive you can be, or how insecure you are about not living up to your own expectations that have been instilled in you by a broken and imposing patriarchal system.",2024-10-27 02:48:58,39,politics,True,1

ltyin5d,"I haven't seen it mentioned that much but even Trump's obsession with ""loyal"" people parallels with Hitler's last days where he had a complete mental breakdown as more and more of his closest aides abandoned him to try and save their own necks

But it does make me wonder for what the broader MAGA movement does post-Trump. In the immediate aftermath of Hitler's death they seemed to go one of two ways. You had the power-hungry arseholes who more than anything tried to keep power. These ones in some sort of narcissistic delusion thought that the occupying forces would just let them keep running the show as if they'd done nothing wrong. I reckon most of the politicians that went all in on Trump will go down this route - try to keep going while pretending they didn't have a decade-long mental break.

What's more concerning were the true believers, especially those in the general populace. In the wake of Hitler's death, there was a shocking number of suicides as people who were so completely brainwashed saw their world collapsing around them. When MAGA has essentially gone the Goebbels route of building up this world of ""evil Democrats"" and all these other enemies with Trump being the only one who can save them all, a collapsing MAGA world without Trump presents a disturbing possibility.

We could also look at the messaging from the party, literally hostile to the idea that the party should be talking to men in ways that appeal to them:

https://thehill.com/opinion/4560169-this-is-not-james-carvilles-1992-democratic-party/

>the Democratic Party is the women’s party. Sixty percent of self-identified Democrats are women. The base of the Democratic Party, its most loyal voters, are women of color. Ninety-two percent of Black women, 65 percent of Latinas and 69 percent of AAPI women voted for Joe Biden in 2020. 

>Carville says Democrats should be talking about beer, hamburgers and football. That may have been good advice in 1992. This week’s Democratic victory in a special election in Alabama, where Democrat Marilyn Lands decisively flipped a Republican seat by running on abortion rights and IVF, suggests otherwise.

>Today’s Democrats are talking about what motivates their voters, and a majority of Americans: that Republicans in 2024 are trying to take away decades of progress for women.

By whom? 

If Democrat voters don't vote they are effectively voting for a genocidal, felonious maniac who has primed the supreme court to allow him to be immune from any form of prosecution for any of his actions while president. He has already promised that they (the left side of the democrats) will be killed by the military. You can't influence future administrations if you are dead. Your future vote counts for nothing is there is no more voting. 

I'm skeptical that anybody so dumb exists. 

>Biden and Harris accepted a ton of far right Jewish nationalist donations, and then buried their heads in the sand on this issue. Now it's going to cost them the election.

Democrats outdonated Republicans by a factor of two this election and Harris has no use for pandering to far right Jewish interests. If the democrats lose, it will because of voter suppression.

The latest polls putting Harris tied or behind by 1 in *national* polls are horrific, and I think show that, in the end, the undecided have gone back to the Republican party, in large part due to inflation and immigration.

Harris might have more of an advantage if on day 1 of the Biden administration they had curtailed immigration, but they waited until election year, and waited for the bipartisan bill from congress which became torpedoed by Trump, so sadly, many voters just aren't convinced because they're easily deceived.

Conservative media leaves out the negative stuff about Trump to present a dishonest image of him, but that's not all they're doing. They're also training their target audience to distrust that overwhelming evidence of Trump's corruption, dishonesty, racism, incompetence, etc., even though they've seen and heard it for themselves. 

Getting their audience to believe that their own eyes and ears can't be trusted sounds like gaslighting to me. Gaslighting them into believing that Harris completely bombed an interview that actually had Trump whining about having to face Harris rather than Biden is just one tiny piece of it. 

The reason that there's such a deep political divide in our country, far worse than anything before the ""tea party,"" is that the two sides used to broadly agree on the basic facts but disagree about principles and priorities. 

But MAGAs don't agree on the basic facts. They've been convinced that the things they can see and hear with their own eyes are not to be trusted, that it's all being manipulated to create a false impression. If something is in the mainstream media, and conservative media are telling a different story, they're conditioned to reject anything that comes from the mainstream media as untrustworthy *even when they can confirm it for themselves* without trusting the mainstream media.

Trump has defended his free-wheeling, sometimes unfollowable oratory style as a deliberate ploy he calls “the weave”—but his latest effort looked more like unraveling.

During Trump’s speech at the Detroit Economic Club—which included a segment insulting the city of Detroit, prompting condemnation from the mayor—the Republican nominee was speaking about how American manufacturing can be affected by other countries’ tariffs before veering off-topic into a discussion about Elon Musk, rockets, and, for some reason, circles.  “It’s very sad to see and it’s so simple,” he said, continuing:

""I mean, you know, this isn’t like Elon with his rocket ships that land within 12 inches on the moon where they wanted to land. Or he gets the engines back, that was the first I realized—I said: ‘Who the hell did that?’ I saw engines about three, four years ago. These things were coming—cylinders, no wings, no nothing—and they’re coming down very slowly, landing on a raft in the middle of the ocean someplace with a circle. Boom. Reminded me of the Biden circles that he used to have, right? He’d have eight circles and he couldn’t fill ’em up. But then I heard he beat us with the popular vote. I don’t know, I don’t know—couldn’t fill up the eight circles. I always loved those circles, they were so beautiful. They were so beautiful to look at. In fact the person that did them—that was the best thing about his—the level of that circle was great. But they couldn’t get people, so they used to have the press stand in those circles, because they couldn’t get the people. Then I heard we lost, ‘Oh, we lost.’ Now, we’re never gonna let that happen again. But we’ve been abused by other countries. We’ve been abused by our own politicians, really more than other countries. I can’t blame them. We’ve been abused by people that represent us in this country—some of them stupid, some of them naive, and some of ’em crooked, frankly.""

Trump appears to be referring to circles on the ground used as a social-distancing measure at President Joe Biden’s campaign events four years ago during the COVID pandemic. Trump was seemingly reminded of them by SpaceX’s reusable rocket boosters because they land on circular targets painted on drone ships. What any of that has to do with tariffs is anyone’s guess.

The circle ramble wasn’t his only bizarre aside during the speech.

When you take away the layers of rambling, it's honestly pathetic how much mental energy Trump spends on convincing himself he's not a loser. He genuinely thinks people following safety protocol during a once-in-a-century pandemic was a coverup for Biden not being popular. He saw the election not as the country deciding who would best be fit to run it, but as the ultimate popularity contest. What he doesn't get is that you can vote for a politician without being so devoted to them that you have to watch them speak in person.

Harris was right when she said Trump was having a tough time processing that he lost.

And there were rumors of some back and forth between them. In fact, there was a public address where Obama joked about Biden's arrogance. It was a joke-but I remember thinking-there was some battle of wills there. Kamala is not a child. Politics is not a children's game-I'm sure there were ego battles and some such other crap between Kamala and Biden, maybe even disagreements and who knows-they privately may even dislike each other. Any adult who has ever had a boss and works a difficult job knows the relationship can often be frayed and is not indicative of the performance of either boss or employee.

Cough Pence Cough. But since they are not children and running the country is not a children's game, they have publically supported each other. Need anyone be reminded, much of Trump's administration officials have publicaly and vocally chided him and/or supported Biden and/or supported Harris and/or opposed his election. So there's that for how little any of this means. As long as Biden hasn't publically called Kamala shit or incompetent, this stupid gossip mongering and reading into every minute action of Biden is so dumb.

So at that time, the DNC basically was juggling between allowing Biden to stay or risking running Harris. They knew that Kamala wasn’t ready, or Biden wouldn’t have to run for another term. Then they got Kamala Tim Walz (trust me, I’m sure Kamala didn’t have a say), who isn’t that popular and who’s also quite extreme.

And if we’re going off of AOC as a standard, there’s 400+ people in the house of congress alone that I’d elect first. She’s got horrid ideas that would doom our economy, regardless of how well she quizzed at BU.

ls9a1aj,"> The military however is an entirely different ball of wax.

Canada deployed their military to shovel snow during a snowstorm, was that an ""entirely different ball of wax"" too? The context matters and you completely ignored it in order to feign outrage here. Within the context of what Trump said you can't explain what the problem with it is because there is none. At best your argument is with the law that allows it, which is a legislative not executive issue. So there is absolutely zero valid basis for your attack on Trump here.

> Tim & Kamala are certainly dangerous for the nation, but not in this particular way.

Just because you are living under a rock doesn't mean we all are. I wonder, at what point does it not become hysteria to you? When you are actually on your way to a camp? Go over and take a look at what gets upvoted on mainstream reddit. Just a week ago I watched them laugh and cheer as a 70 year old gold star mom was sentenced to spend the rest of her life in prison for doing what she thought was her civil duty under the law - even according to their own twisted account of events she was a non-violent first time offender with no articulable victim or harm that resulted. We can even show examples of their own political allies doing the same thing (but in a way that actually violates the law and did cause real harm) yet they don't care. It is plainly obvious they don't care about the principles of law or any factual matter of guilt or innocence in these cases, rather they are just excuses to hold witch trials and perform a modern day lynching. This isn't just on reddit this is the actual mainstream sentiment of most democrats. You can read the judges opinions and listen to them on video - their speech is filled with hate and vitriol for us because of who we are not because of any particular thing that we did.

This is behavior that demonstrates a level of conditioning among the population that is very much in line with what we saw in the lead up to nazi germany, the cultural revolution in China, and many other such events throughout history. Be in denial about it all you want, from my perspective you are an ignorant fool if you're still in denial about what is going on at this point when it's literally right in front of your very eyes.",2024-10-16 03:15:27,1,Conservative,True,0

When you called me out on it I explained my position and unlike you I expanded on the reasons behind it. You on the other hand just repeated your position each time and had nothing to say in response to the points that I raised.

> Trump certainly didn't help himself by saying he would use the military against ""internal enemies""

He didn't say that. Now you are just lying. Post the clip. I saw what CNN did they took one clip where he was talking about the ""enemy within"" and then they cut and spliced it with his comments about the military which was in a different context. Do you disagree that we have an enemy within? The democrats say Trump is an enemy within, they say him and his people are a threat to the country. So what is your point here exactly other than to spread this democrat propaganda narrative that isn't based in reality?

> While Harris will undoubtedly be bad for the country, it's extremely unlikely that she'll start rounding up Trump supporters and putting them in camps.

Ok and I disagree with you. Maybe you feel safe because you aren't that involved in politics. Those who are more overtly involved in politics are definitely at risk if those guilty of spearheading their political persecution so far have those actions validated and supported by the population on election day. You should read up on the cultural revolution and how it happened because you seem completely oblivious to it and in denial.

However, take a look at the margins in some of the swing state polls i listed in this post. Trump's edge is less than 1% in a lot of these states.

Like, should I hate my parents because they were raised as traditional Mexican Catholics and are thus conservative? (I do think I've convinced them to vote for Kamala, even though they heavily dislike her).

I'm not at all qualified to give advice (heck, I can't even vote thanks to my age), but if you want to get your wife to not vote Trump I'd say hammer home Trump's association to Project 2025. He's recently been denying any connection, but he had some of the people behind it on his cabinet last year. Additionally, they have 100% guaranteed spots on his hypothetical cabinet, the Heritage Foundation (think tank behind Project 2025) supports Republicans, Trump himself and JD Vance has praised the project and the Heritage Foundation, and some right-wingers are mad at Trump trying to distance himself from it.

So, what is Project 2025? It's the far right's plan to transform the US into a Christian dictatorship, only allowing the 'perfect' white, heterosexual nuclear family as citizens. Note only one sect of Christianity will come out on top, others (like mine, Catholicism) will likely be stamped out. For proof, look at the Pilgrims' reason for fleeing Europe, the Salem Witch Trials, and the reason Rhode Island was established in the first place. It means the end of the freedoms that make America, America as we know, never mind destroying democracy. Basically, all the Amendments will go bye-bye, along with most of the Constitution.

If you want more reasons, show her clips of Nazis at Trump's rally. His 'concepts of an idea' bit from the debate regarding a plan around (I think) healthcare. The times he's called the city he's campaigning in trash. His 'I don't care about you, I just want your vote' bit he told supporters at a rally. How he won't release medical records over being shot (it looks like a piece of glass chipped him, not the bullet). Hiding behind a pixeglass barrier from assassins while preaching gun freedom. His 'grab them by the pussy' comment. His looking at underage teenagers at a show he owns because he can. Him being found guilty of rape. Telling people to inject bleach into their veins to combat Covid. His somehow bankrupting casinos as proof of his economic prowess. If you want more examples, just ask.

But but but but but, if all you want to do is live with your wife who you obviously love, then ask her to not bring up politics. Ask your family to do the same. Without the rift politics can cause, I think you'll get along just fine. It might sting knowing you're voting for opposite sides, so your votes cancel out, but other than that no politics is a fairly happy way to live.

lrth265,"I'm not saying you have no reason to be concerned, but just keep in mind:

1. The movement in polls is so slight, it's just as likely to be statistical noise as actual changes in opinion.

2. There are enough polls circulating right now that you could support virtually any narrative you wanted. And the overwhelming narrative right now is that Harris is faltering (just like a month ago it was Harris was crushing it, and the month before that it was Harris was experiencing a brief honeymoon that would vanish, and the month before that it was Trump was a deadlock for the election, and the month before that is was Biden was behind but prepping for a post-debate bounce).

3. Harris is running behind Biden with the groups you mentioned, and yet she's still tied or leading Trump. How is that possible? Because she's gained with other groups over Biden, such as educated white voters, seniors and women. But when was the last time you saw a headline like, ""Trump bleeding support among the educated and seniors""? Again, you can selectively use data to craft basically any narrative you want.

4. Polls are a helpful tool for campaigns to determine whether their message is effective and where to allocate resources. As a tool for predicting future outcomes along the margins, they are fairly worthless. If polling in early-to-mid October was spot on, Gore, Kerry, Romney and Clinton would have won, and Biden's election would have been a blowout.

Don't let your obvious disdain of Harris and of America (the comment about Harris seeing North Korea as allies is puzzling and mind-boggling from you when that is [absolutely not the case](https://twitter.com/RpsAgainstTrump/status/1826820558891213189?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1826820558891213189%7Ctwgr%5Ea33af9bfdb9b79113e7ec8cf1b1d663a9ba821fb%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hindustantimes.com%2Fworld-news%2Fus-news%2Fkamala-harris-wows-netizens-as-she-refuses-to-cozy-up-to-dictators-like-unserious-trump-obama-level-of-greatness-101724387465251.html) ) cloud an opportunity to understand better how we're thinking.

Even though the margins are getting increasingly thin, the state is still perceived as hard red, and voter turnout is low as a result.

Then suddenly it was ""so obvious"" and everyone was talking about it like it was inevitable.

The moment Ds win a statewide Texas election, not only will voter turnout improve but Democrats will start funneling a shit-ton of money into every single election. They'll start building the most high-effort GOTV effort the party's ever seen in a single state, simply because of the sheer amount of upsides there are to be able to turn Texas blue. They just need to see evidence that it's possible, that the state's worth investing in. One win could make the dam burst.

These people are not pragmatic and, in their idealistic minds, they think the whole system should burn down so they can rebuild it how they want. The problem? There is absolutely no plan, no organization, no nothing...it's just ""vote for a third party"".

luk983s,"I’ll take my down votes for this but I’m someone who just cast a down ballot dem ticket with “uncommitted” in the top spot. I’m in a safe red state (at least in the presidential election) so my ballot was “performative” regardless of who I picked so you can call me that if you like. I probably would have voted for her in a swing state. 

 Here’s why I did what I did. 

Kamala is overall to the right of myself. Not a deal breaker in itself but certainly made this next part easier. I cannot describe what is happening in Gaza as anything other than a genocide. We are funding that genocide to the tune of 70% of the total cost. The Biden admin has had many furrowed brows and “tense conversations” and that seems to make Bibi mad but it hasn’t changed that we have given them every weapon they have asked for and then some (we sent in air craft carriers to break a blockade). 

As someone whose actual stance is something close to stop all arms immediately, compromise would be something like conditional arms sales, under conditions of a one state solution with equal rights for Palestine and Jews. Instead, I’m told that “compromise” is unconditional, unlimited arms sales but with a frowny face and yeah that’s not good enough in the face of genocide. Not good enough that don’t give what little protest I can. 

I think all of this is just deck chairs of the titanic though because if you are fighting for the votes of single issue Gaza voters your campaign probably failed the fundamentals of building a solid coalition. ",2024-10-30 04:41:05,1,PoliticalDiscussion,True,1

luk5bdr,"It’s the unwillingness to look at history that makes me understand why courting single-issue voters isn’t high on the Harris agenda. The GOP has been pushing a weird monarchist agenda for the last 20 years. Their entire goal is to obstruct progress at every available opportunity. At this point, they don’t even bother piecing together plans and policies, because the goal is not to create anything other than oligarchy with theocratic support. Then there’s the history with elections. The GOP (for the last twenty years) have crafted their campaigning on how bad the democrats are for the country and the world, despite overwhelming evidence that whatever stints at prosperity and progress we enjoy are directly linked to their time in office. But come election time, there’s always a third party candidate that belays down from the sky to shout disenfranchised dems over to a different side. It’s fine to not want to be a Democrat — so build up a third party and support it from moment one. It’s too late to do that now, since it’s general election time, and one of two people is going to win. We’re getting firehosed with propaganda, and it baffles me that so many leftists believe they’re uniquely immune to this, despite fixating on one point in politics exclusively for over a year, and prioritizing it over every other action that could lead to more death, and has lead to more death in the past.

> The argument Donald Trump is worse conflicts with A, and the argument that they should compromise conflicts with B. Both seem to be received poorly by this group of voters.

The thing is, this is a classic case of not being able to reason someone out of a position they didn't reason themselves into.  The number of people who believe the myth that the conflict is genocide cannot be reasoned with, because it's a fact-free emotional argument that, at best, amplifies a hate narrative.

[An Eight-point Brief On Lesser Evil Voting](https://chomsky.info/an-eight-point-brief-for-lev-lesser-evil-voting/)

>Another point of disagreement involves the ethical/moral principle sometimes referred to as the “politics of moral witness.” Generally associated with the religious left, secular leftists implicitly invoke it when they reject LEV on the grounds that “a lesser of two evils is still evil.” Leaving aside the obvious rejoinder that **this is exactly the point of lesser evil voting-i.e. to do less evil**, what needs to be challenged is the assumption that voting should be seen as a form of individual self-expression rather than as an act to be judged on its likely consequences. The basic moral principle at stake is simple: **not only must we take responsibility for our actions, but the consequences of our actions for others are a far more important consideration than feeling good about ourselves.**

Your problem isn't that she's ignoring ""voters"", your problem is that she's trying to win an election by listening to a bigger block of voters than the block of voters you represent

I think that's partially true, but it's missing a price of the puzzle. I might be naive about this but I genuinely believe that, at least on the left, there are more people against the genocide (let's call them group A) than there are for it (group B). The real problem is that out of that group A, a large majority of them are ready to compromise out of fear of the insanity that comes with Trump. The remaining folks from group A feel horrified by that compromise, we can call them group C. 

Group C is smaller than group B. Every person willing to compromise in group A gives power to group B. This is sadly one of the downsides to being reasonable people, you unintentionally give a green light to the people who rely on you to ignore you and focus on the people who are unreasonable. 

>Someday, hopefully, the number of voters who care about Palestinians will approach the number of pro-genocide voters - and at that point a presidential candidate trying to win elections will change their stance.  

If nobody remains in group C, it doesn't matter how many people are in A. There have to be people willing to put their foot down for it to actually make a difference. 

> The solution to that is to advocate for your position, change minds, answer polls, and vote in primaries. 

I agree. Let's be honest though, the primaries didn't matter this election. We glossed over it because too much was at stake to rock the boat, so much so that we ignored any signs that Biden might not be the ideal choice until his debate with Trump. At least we did something about that, but the liberals are still playing conservatively, when they are supposed be the party of change. 

If there's nobody pushing back then that's proof to politician that it's not worth putting time and effort into doing something different during the next election. None of the solutions you suggested work without them worrying about of losing the elections over it.",2024-10-30 04:41:05,1,PoliticalDiscussion,True,1

luhl5wc,"I mean sure why is it after 9/11 the US didn't just carpet bomb Saudi Arabia regardless of the mass human casualties. We easily could have nuked the entire country before any retaliation given most of the hijackers came from there and intelligence data shows part of the royal family funded it I would assume we didn't because there would have been mass global protests after the US killed millions of civilians. But in your mind that would have been totally justified right. And maybe it still is. Why don't you shift some of your energy into calling for the US to get even given you have absolutely zero limit to how many civilians need to die to get retribution.  37 million live in Saudi Arabia, but you haven't set a limit so we will just assume you are fine with wiping every single one out to get back at those that funded the attack right?

ltwdnru,"I do think Donald Trump has a better shot at winning this election, but I wouldn't be surprised if Harris wins against betting odds.

Betting usually happens in the background, but this year, Donald Trump and his running mate Elon Musk have frequently advertised their numbers online, this has caused the number of right-wing bettors that consume ""red-wave"" sources on those platforms to soar. When Trump's betting odds soared in mid-October, nothing fundamentally changed from the beginning of the month, except, well, Elon Musk promoting the platform when Trump took the slightest lead. The next day, Trump's odds soared to 60%, and that was no coincidence. The wisdom of the crowd loses functionality if most of the bettors are all coming straight out of a MAGA rally. 

But why don't Kamala Harris supporters join in to make lots of money? I am sure they are, but I wouldn't be surprised if some are nervous. No candidate has won the election when their opponent leads by 20% in the betting markets in October. There are a lot of hard-core bettors who are inclined to bet against that, but is your average gambling Joe going to? It might be becoming a sort of bubble, where people bet Trump *because* he is leading by so much on these platforms. Ultimately, the idea Trump could win is based on a handful of core assumptions that may be proven fallible on election night, but we'll see. Anyway, those are just my thoughts, there is a really good chance I'm wrong.",2024-10-26 05:11:41,1,PoliticalDiscussion,True,1
ltvs646,"So, I think a lot of people here are not familiar with how betting works. 

1. The current betting pool for the election is well over $2B, so a single $10m bet is not going to make a big difference. 

2. Betting on a candidate is not akin to any kind of market manipulation - what market are you trying to influence?

3. Betting on elections is a uniquely singular process, different from sports betting in a primary fashion - bettors have an opportunity to directly impact the outcome when THEY cast their vote. The same can’t be said for people who bet on, say, an NBA game. 

4. The oddsmakers have a direct incentive to predict the outcome correctly. They need to balance the flow of money and/or have the favorite win so they don’t end up massively in the hole when it comes time to pay everyone. 

In the example that has been given multiple times about large $10m bets coming in for Trump, if that was enough to move the needle, they would offset that action by dramatically improving the odds for Kamala so they could draw money back to the opposing stance. The net impact of this is how you get the “line” - and it corrects quickly, based on money flow. There are some exceptions, but the betting line is generally pretty representative of the current state of the public opinion about an event, sports outcome, etc.",2024-10-26 05:11:41,1,PoliticalDiscussion,True,1

ltw3ybs,"In sports sure. But you not only need 1.5 million people to vote *on politics* but you also need all 1.5 million to vote exclusively for kamala. In order to offset trumps lead from 1 30 million bet, kamala has to actually have a lead of 1.5 million in betters. 

This is why the market doesn't reflect the reality of the race. The race 1 person votes cancelation out another's, it doesn't take 1.5 million voters to cancel out 1 persons vote like this betting market requires. Either that or you need 1 person to bet 30 million in kamala favor. Which is why the market isn't a reflection on the election, it's a reflection for what rich people want the election results to be.

I'm not shitting on people who bet in it or saying you have to be rich to bet in it. I'm saying rich people can sway it. The fact that musk can bet 100mil tomorrow and skew the odds 5% makes this whole thing inaccurate and is just dependent on an equal number of gamblers on both sides with an equal number of resources both betting at the same volume. The fact is, volume is a measurement that doesn't apply in terms of individual voters.

Maybe this will help.

In an election the only factor that matters is the number of voters. 

If team As # of  voters > team Bs number of voters, team A wins. If not, team b wins. Simple, only 1 factor matters and that is voter numbers

On the betting markets there are 2 factors to determine the odds, 1 is # of betters and the other is the size of the bet 

If team As # of betters > team Bs number of betters, the odds can show that team B is winning because of the factor of  bet size being greater. 

Thus factor throws off the market by accounting for the size of bets, when an election the only thing that matters is the number of voters. It doesn't matter how enthusiastic a single voter is, or how much money they have, every vote is worth 1, every bet is not worth 1, therefore 1 really enthusiastic better betting 10 skews the data.",2024-10-26 05:11:41,2,PoliticalDiscussion,True,1
ltw73fu,"That's actually why they can't interfere with betting odds. Because the odds are determinitive of pay out. You also now have an unknown hand weighing things out which is another thing that skews the results because now it isn't even reflective of what betters want or how confident betters are on their candidate, now it is just about what 1 company needs the odds to be to stay in business. 

It doesn't have to reflect the actual likelihood of a candidate winning, it only has to reflect the amount of money put in - their profit margin. 

I'm sorry, we have gone through the math and now you are saying the house has supernatural knowledge of how voters will really vote (not based on polls) and will be able to manipulate the betting market to reflect reality regardless of money put into the market. You understand how everything you're arguing leads to less accuracy in the market right? Like you're now adding more factors that don't exist in an election. Because now the market isn't just about the number of betters, which BTW is the only factor in an election is the number of voters. Now you've added weighted voting where some voters hold more valuable votes, but now you have introduced a deep state element that will change the tallies to reflect the reality they believe will happen. And are claiming the the voters being weighted and the hand of the deep state are gonna be more accurate than polls that only factor in the number of voters. 

There are too many external factors in betting markets for them to be accurate in an election. Thats just the reality. Doesn't mean you can't bet on them or like them. But they are too easily manipulated to look at them and say they are the most accurate.

So the question becomes, why are people like trump and musk telling you that the most manipulatable ""poll"" is the most accurate. The answer is simple. They want you to believe in those markets so if they lose they can point and say ""no, polymarket said we were up 20% there's no way we lost read claim the election was rigged. The reality is that they are rigging the market that they are going to point to to claim the election is rigged.

Mail-in votes can (and do) often arrive after election day.  As long as they are postmarked by election day or earlier, they are still counted & are added to the total during the days and weeks that follow the election.

 Unlike early voting, I've seen no sign that mail voting is anywhere nearly as popular this year as it was in 2020, so it will likely have a far smaller impact on the election than it did in 2020.  

Moreover, 2020 was a massive outlier in that most mail-in voters were Democrats that favored covid restrictions on public gathering, so the mail-in votes had a tremendous democratic slant. Traditionally, however, a lot of mail-in votes originate from military personnel stationed abroad, which are likely to strongly favor Trump.

Lincoln defended his actions as justified in times of rebellion or invasion, when public safety was at stake. He later sought retroactive authorization from Congress, which granted it, effectively legalizing his emergency measures.

Lincoln’s actions highlight an important tension between the branches of government, particularly during emergencies. While in extreme circumstances, the executive might take actions that challenge judicial authority, these actions are highly controversial and often provoke constitutional debate. They are usually justified under extraordinary circumstances, like war or national crises, but they also raise concerns about the erosion of the rule of law and separation of powers.

During Bush's term Pelosi used the same technique but escalated it, even on bipartisan legislation which was favorable to Democrats. The strategy worked better for Democrats at the time because they were more likely to hold the house than the presidency, so decreasing a Republican president's effectiveness was seen as a means of electing a Democrat.

Maybe all of the attacks against and mishaps of Trump makes supporters more defensive.


Maybe the swarm of political ads has a ROI.


I cannot say for sure as to why. But I do know that Trump signs are returning in force, the water-cooler discussions are more favorable, and people are trenching into their sides.

Clinton used her clout to get any serious contender to stay out of the primary, and again her influence over the superdelegates to steamroll her one opposition in the primary. And then again this year, Democrats could have had an open primary, but gambled that Biden would either be able to continue through his age or Harris would be up to the task.

ls4sf2b,"Because something like half a million people hold the key to deciding whether or not we go full fascism or stave it off a little longer.

I don't know if I'd say she's shifted right on things like healthcare or even gun reform.

On the former: expanding Medicare to include live-in care is monumental and something no one else has brought up. Hospice care, even at home, is incredibly expensive. Most boomers are in their 60s and 70s. The average life span in the U.S. is about 77.5 years, according to the CDC. So they're getting to that ""average"" age about now or getting close to it.

On the latter: This is just me being a little pedantic, but dropping the weapons buy back program isn't necessarily the same as moving right. She's still advocating for closing loopholes and expanding background checks -- what she calls ""common sense"" gun reform. The GOP calls that government overreach, but they scream that about anything that they dislike for one reason or another.

Her position on fracking hasn't changed since 2016. It's literally one thing she's been vocally consistent about because she doesn't feel like it's a big enough deal to make a federal case about it.

The border has and always will be contentious because the majority of Americans don't understand how our southern border or how sanctuary or even legal immigration works. Immigrants have long been a boogeyman for whichever party wants to make it an issue (nevermind that 65% of Americans live within the 100-mile ""border zone"" per Bloomberg). To answer your question, though: she's said several times that Congress had a tough bipartisan border bill that Trump personally killed. So I think her platform is really playing off that.

She's been campaigning heavily in the swing states and hitting the rust belt hard. The so-called blue-collar workers hold the key to fascism or democracy and for some reason care a lot about the southern border (apparently). I know that losing manufacturing jobs is a big concern of theirs as well as gun rights.

ls5m23g,"* Turnout in 2020 was historic because covid meant more people could vote by mail, people had nothing better to do, and because Trump drove turnout on both sides. Whether they loved or hated him, people felt strongly about Trump. But turnout in 2020 was not historic due to voters  being super excited about Biden and his platform.

* Biden won, but it was very close in the decisive states and he underperformed his polls hugely. Against the backdrop of the worst public health crisis in a century which the incumbent had fumbled badly, plus the worst racial protests in 30 years which supercharged black turnout, Biden's performance in 2020 really wasn't anything special. 

* A lot of the most progressive demands from 2020, like defunding the police or support for practically open borders, are massively unpopular and have inflicted lasting damage on the Democratic brand. 

* At a time when voters are still pissed off about the 2021-23 inflation surge and when the federal deficit is reaching record heights, there is simply no appetite among the electorate for healthcare reform or for climate policies which drive up cost of living even further,  like e.g. ambitious decarbonization goals.

ls5g5uo,"My view point:
Both candidates have shifted more center. Statistically most people are moderate. They may be more left on some issues and more right on others, for the most part people aren't extreme. 
Given that, each party has to kind of adapt and be less extreme while trying to hold on to the classical values of their party so they can keep their current voters and try to get independents/undecided. 
Trump hasn't changed a whole lot, he's less intense about a few things and very firm on others. 
Harris, as said by someone else (🐦) is being pragmatic and I'm sure her team knows that her very, very progressive views in 19/20 did her a huge disservice and as the campaign progresses, she's realizing that to appeal to center people, she needs to be more center and that some of Trump's/Republican policies/ideas are appealing to both sides of voters so to compensate for her previous progressive views, she's shifting center/right on some things. 
And honestly, no one I knew that voted for Biden voted because they liked him. They voted bc he wasn't Trump (myself included). Biden was peculiar at best, with some okay ideas but mostly fluff that wouldn't happen (student debt relief) and ""I'm not trump!"" And Harris, no one liked back then. Again, this is anecdotal but none of us liked her at all, and continued to not like her through the admin. 
Her starting her campaign as ""not trump"" and fluff ideas wasn't working, her policies being different in person vs her teams statements didn't work, progressive ideals didn't really work, so now she's centering more and adapting some moderate conservative ideals in the name of gaining votes. 
Which, personally, I can't stand. I love someone adapting based on what the voters want but within reason, changing her position either in speech or in statement every time I watch or read anything on her is just shining an inconsistent ""I'll say anything to get votes"" light on her, reflecting the constant ""idek who she is now"" rhetoric I see going around. ",2024-10-15 16:41:58,-1,PoliticalDiscussion,True,0

Without consideration if the Presidential position would still function like this, a much more fair way of doing things is changing elections to be a vote for the percent of time a president will stay in office, rather than a winner taking all 4 years. Maybe any votes that add up to less than like 6 months or a year would be evenly distributed among other candidates so you don't get presidents switching out all the time.

  
I think in conclusion it just so happens Republicans are currently under-represented in office compared to their percent of votes. Switching to OPs described voting system would actually make elections more unfair than they currently are. And finally, the whole system is fucked so anything short of a major overhaul probably won't result in anything better than what we've got",2024-10-09 13:48:20,1,PoliticalDiscussion,True,1

    (9 electoral votes) * (163,387 votes for Trump) / (318,608 total votes) = 1.54 (rounded to 2 digits)

I rounded to whole numbers, so I gave him 2 electoral votes in this math, Hillary got 1 electoral vote, and everybody else got 0.

I don't know how electoral votes would be partitioned if we proportioned them by popular vote, but it seems most likely that they would be rounded to whole numbers and states wouldn't award fractional votes.

The main exceptions are know by the short hands Fight words , riot and frie .

Fighting wards cover personal insults between people. It's also the weakest of the known forms of no protected speech.

The fire exaction gets it name for a quote in a court ruling. "" You're not allowed to shoot fire in a crowded theater"" basically you can insist a mass panic for No reason in an environment where people can get hurt. 

The last exaction is the Riot but is based on intended. You not allowed to initially start a Riot or violent Insurrection against the US government. AKA Trump's actions on January 6 are not protected under the first amendment.

The main test for this is where you are trying to convince people to rebel against the government and or start a Riot. If so, a Riot actually happen.

I still think there's room for improvement.  For instance you've only found 8 ""true"" things Harris has said?  Seems like you could find more than that from a single speech.  Even with Harris jumping in late we couldn't get more than 65 compared to over 1,000 for Trump.  Again the take away here for many is that Trump told the truth 36 times compared to only 8 for Harris.

Also several of her half truths and lower ratings rely on taking Trump's word for on topics he's constantly lied about or flip flopped on.  For example, when Harris says Trump is going to repeal ACA, that doesn't seem like a half truth to me.  He already tried it once, he's flipped back and forth depending on the crowd about whether he wants to do it again and even when he says he won't, we'd be idiots to actually believe it.

lvdpbu3,"A brief list of dissimilarities between 2016 and today, not meant to be a complete one:

* Hillary's campaign completely wrote off Trump, possibly until the final days of the campaign. Harris's has not.
* Trump was an energizing, dynamic campaigner who seized on a lot of issues people cared about. Trump, today, is talking about Hannibal Lecter, sharks, boating accidents, Haitians eating dogs and cats, and how much he does not want to be on the campaign trail. And he's fucking boring.
* Hillary was a competent but boring campaigner who really would have been much more suited to governing than getting voters out. Harris has been positively electric in addition to being competent.
* In 2016, Trump was kind of viewed as a sane and stable quantity. I'm not sure whether that's entirely changed, but for a lot of people it has.
* Continuing exposure to Trump benefited him when people didn't really know who this guy was. Now, it's exhausting. We've spent nine years with this guy lying about everything. Crowd sizes. His involvement with Jeffrey Epstein. Take your pick.
* In 2016, the Trump campaign was very disciplined. In 2024, they're barely a functioning organization.
* The Hillary campaign mostly disregarded the blue wall states (IIRC, there were one or two that Hillary never hit even once). The Harris campaign is spending the last few days in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, with a couple of stops in NC.
* There is no ""Comey letter"" equivalent for the Harris campaign.
* There is a ""Comey letter"" equivalent for the Trump campaign. Completely self-inflicted.

lvczqy8,"John Oliver’s monologue to undecided voters who are hesitant to vote for Harris (particularly because of Gaza) was powerful, and he hit the nail on the head. Politics is not just voting for someone who does exactly what you want *right now*. It’s also about voting for someone who you know has your same set of ideals and *can be pushed/convinced* to align with you later.

Gay marriage is a great example of this. Even Obama and Biden used to say they’re not in favor of legalizing gay marriage. But they could be convinced that it’s actually right, and then they shifted their stance. Republicans could *never* have done the same. Their evangelical base would hate it. 

And this is the same reason Mark Cuban said he endorsed Harris. Even if he doesn’t agree with her on everything (like unrealized gains tax on multi-millionaires), he says he knows Harris is actually competent and can be convinced of things if given facts. Trump will just do what his emotions or his yes-men encourage him to do. Cuban even said that “she’s not going to pass the unrealized gain tax, if she does, then I’m not supporting her next time”, indicating that he’s pretty confident that he’ll be able to convince her not to push for it.

I've seen conflicting data on this, with some saying 2020 was 9.7 million early votes, others are saying less, but even if that's true, that was during a pandemic environment with a full week's extra time of early voting. Hitting about 9 million in a ""normal"" election environment is very, very promising. Especially with stronger turnout in urban areas like Houston this cycle.

I cannot promise anything. Lord knows this state disappoints us so many times, but the chance of Allred beating Cruz is now very real. The catch is that we need to turn out the final group of lower propensity Dem leaning voters in the next 2 days. Reach out to them today and tomorrow and help them come up with a voting plan on Tuesday. Polls will be open 7AM-7PM on Tuesday the 5th, but are closed today and tomorrow. Polls will be open in many more locations, despite all of the state's history of shenanigans. Registered voters increased to somewhere past 18 million voters this cycle, over 1 million more since 2022 alone. Party affiliation isn't required here, so don't read into those who attempt to estimate it too much, and there are signs of weaknesses for Trump in the rural areas this cycle.

Can Texas flip? I don't know, but if it can, the turnout we generate in the next 2 days will be the determining factor. And we really, really need more Dem senators, so this election has national implications.

Help us finally send Cruz packin', and maybe we'll get some extra surprises to go along with it. If the demographic trends in the Selzer poll hold some national trends (where women living under abortion restrictions are voting against them in record numbers), that trend could easily hold nationally and impact the southern states as well (where the restrictions are just as bad, if not worse than Iowa).

lv07j7r,"Posted this in the older thread. Reposting here - 

Georgia's early voting has ended, and from an analytical standpoint, every metric I'd want to see for a Harris victory is present.

Let's break down why. 🍑

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681109546353097?s=46

Metro Atlanta finished strong, with large counties recording ~80,000 votes in just the final two hours (5-7 PM) yesterday.

Polls closed in rural counties at 5 pm, so Democratic counties drove that final surge.

This surge could preview Election Day potential.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681112780423197?s=46

Current early voting totals in key counties:

Fulton: 57.9%

DeKalb: 58.1%

Gwinnett: 54.6%

Cobb: 60.2%

Clayton: 46.3%

Chatham: 48.1%

Richmond: 42.8%

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681115032781024?s=46

The story varies significantly by county. Gwinnett, despite its size and importance, has the most ground to cover to match its total 2020 turnout.

At 54.6%, it needs 96.2% of its 2020 Election Day performance to match overall 2020 turnout.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681117633233217?s=46

Other Metro Atlanta counties have built more cushion through early voting.

DeKalb can match 2020 with 79.6% of its previous Election Day turnout.

Cobb, thanks to strong early voting at 60.2%, needs just 75.8%.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681120045027676?s=46

Fulton, Clayton, and Chatham all need about 67% of their 2020 Election Day numbers - significant cushion built through early voting success.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681140727169382?s=46

A key indicator for Harris:

Women's turnout has already exceeded 2020 levels, reaching 56% versus 55.3% in the last cycle.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681357752668251?s=46

The 2020 to 2024 comparison reveals a crucial shift: Metro Atlanta voted heavily by mail in 2020 due to COVID.

This year, a large pool of traditional Election Day voters remains available.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681444654735746?s=46

Meanwhile, rural northeast Georgia—Republican strongholds—has nearly exhausted its voter pool, with few Election Day voters left.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681538087035022?s=46

Metro Atlanta as well as other blue counties all retain substantial untapped potential voters.

Those final two hours of early voting demonstrated the capacity for high turnout in these population centers.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681756518096930?s=46

This sets up a fascinating Election Day dynamic:

Metro Atlanta and other blue counties have both more work to do AND more voters available to do it.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681878492569669?s=46

The pressure point is Gwinnett, where matching 2020 numbers will require the strongest Election Day performance relative to last cycle.

If you have some time between now and Election Day, please volunteer to canvass and help GOTV.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852682170193875302?s=46

Let's return to the Harris victory metrics:

I’m not seeing any signs of Democratic demoralization in Metro Atlanta's strong early voting numbers, while Trump faces headwinds in maxed-out rural areas.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852682392391303673?s=46

These aren't predictions - they're patterns.

But the checklist of what Harris would need for victory in Georgia has been steadily filled during early voting.

lv54u00,"Some closing thoughts for the night.

If after all of this, that

- Fundraising 10x-10000x your opponent week by week doesn't matter
- Knocking hundreds of thousands of doors and making almost a million calls per swing state doesn't matter
- Gaining heavily in red state, district, and county polls doesn't matter
- Each of the Senate candidates running 5 ahead from the presidential ticket in an age where ticket splitting doesn't happen doesn't matter
- A giant enthusiasm gap, where people are packing arenas for you of 20k-30k capacity, if not more, and your opponent isn't packing small venues of 3k to 4k doesn't matter
- A gigantic different in favorability between you and your opponent doesn't matter
- Early votes and exit polling from early voting doesn't matter
- Absorbing all of the defects from your opponent's terribly divisive campaign doesn't matter

And receiving the go-ahead from the greatest polling prognosticator in the nation doesn't matter, on top of plenty of other signs..

And Trump still wins? There was nothing to do.

This was a perfect campaign, start to finish, headed by the tailwinds of Roe v. Wade, January 6th.

https://xcancel.com/voterstomorrow/status/1852437650457640976?s=46

According to our projected youth early vote turnout benchmarks, which are based on 2022 voting preference rates, young voters nationally have blown past their early vote turnout projection by 20%.

Projection Chart of youth turnout in PA, MI, NC, GA & National - https://xcancel.com/voterstomorrow/status/1852437651934126526?s=46

Beyond projections, data from across the country shows young voters are on track to break youth voter turnout records.

Data from the Georgia Secretary of State shows voters 18-24 years old having cast more early votes (approx. 225,000) than those aged 25-29, 30-34, and 35-39.

https://xcancel.com/voterstomorrow/status/1852437653888594406?s=46

On top of that, our team of chapters and organizers has:
- hosted over 100 actions on campuses to help register young voters
- helped over 50,000 voters access critical voting information
- made over 19 million texts and calls to young people, helping them create voting plans

https://xcancel.com/voterstomorrow/status/1852437655079788829?s=46

… A showdown is brewing in FL as DOJ informs the state that they intend to send in election monitors, with Desantis responding immediately that the federal monitors will not be allowing inside polling locations. Nothing like this has happened in America since the Civil Rights Movement in the 60s. Expect this to be litigated on an emergency basis immediately.

… Desantis’s Secretary of State Cord Byrd said that “the presence of federal law enforcement inside polling places would be counterproductive and could potentially undermine confidence in the election.” The confidence in GOP dominance everywhere in FL maybe.… Hopefully the case will not be assigned to Aileen Cannon.

... Mike Johnson pledged to repeal the CHIPS and Science Act which has been praised and credited by REPUBLICAN elected officials all over the country for the high tech, well paying jobs it is creating while expanding the US lead in tech with competing countries that have been rapidly catching up… This comes one day after he was caught on a hot mic pledging to repeal Obamacare.

… MI Gov Gretchen Whitmer responded that killing the CHIPS Act would be “a complete disaster for thousands of Michigan workers relying on the jobs that this legislation provides.

… Liz Cheney called on George W. Bush today to break his silence and endorse Harris: “I can’t explain why George W. Bush hasn’t spoken out, but I think it’s time, and I wish that he would.”

… The US Supreme Court has rejected an emergency appeal from Republicans attempting to prevent thousands of provisional ballots from being counted. Trump’s favorite legal analyst Jonathan Turley was critical of the decision.

… Trump went on several more unhinged, deranged rants in his appearance with Tucker Carlson last night. At one point he criticized Liz Cheney’s past foreign policy decisions and said that she should be forced to stand in front of 9 enemy soldiers with guns pointed at her face.

… Arizona AG Kris Mayes said she is investigating Trump’s comments as a possible crime: “I have already asked my criminal division chief to start looking at that statement, analyzing it for whether it qualifies as a death threat under AZ law.”

… Trump also called President Biden “a stupid bastard” and VP Harris “a sleaze bag.”

… Harris Senior Advisor Ian Sams: “Trump is talking about sending a prominent Republican to a firing squad. VP Harris is talking about sending one to her Cabinet.”

… Liz Cheney responded: “This is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death. We cannot entrust our country and our freedom to a petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant.”

… Harris made a statement to the press about Trump’s remarks: “He has increased his violent rhetoric about political opponents and in great detail, suggested rifles should be trained on former representative Liz Cheney. This must be disqualifying.”

… Last June, Trump reposted a Truth Social post that said that Cheney was guilty of “treason” and called for her to be given a televised trial before a military tribunal.   
  
… The FBI received a referral to investigate Mike Lindell’s ‘Election Crime Bureau’ after the group sent emails to elections workers asking them personal questions about their background and employment. Lindell told ABC: “I want to get rid of the electronic voting machines and you should care about it too. There’s nothing wrong with the survey.” We will see if the FBI agrees.

… Trump also claimed that he had 107,000 people at his NJ rally, 101,000 people at his PA rally, and 114,000 people at Coachella. Not even remotely close for the congenital liar.

… Senior Harris campaign officials told WaPo that their internal data shows that they are winning late deciders in battleground states by over 10 points, with most of them citing Trump’s insane and racist rally at MSG as their reason for deciding on Harris.

… Harris Senior Advisor David Plouffe: “It’s helpful, from experience (Obama 2012), to be closing a presidential campaign with late deciding voters breaking by double digits to you and the remaining undecideds looking more friendly to you than you opponent.”

… GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger says that there is a coordinated campaign on right-wing social media to spread fake videos and disinformation about the election in GA and he believes that Russia is the source of it. The most egregious video was from a man who claimed he was a migrant from Haiti and voted illegally in the election for Harris.… The Office of the Director of National Intelligence then issued a statement that the videos did, in fact, originate in Russia.

… Bannon had Scott Presler on where they complained that long lines at polling places in a heavy Republican area of PA was “voter suppression,” which has been the Democratic position for years. Bannon: “How is a working class person supposed to go and wait 5+ hours to vote?”

… Stephen Miller was melting down all day on Twitter, making panicked post after panicked post. He started off in the morning ranting about media coverage of Trump’s Cheney comments.

lv076z3,"Georgia's early voting has ended, and from an analytical standpoint, every metric I'd want to see for a Harris victory is present. 

Let's break down why. 🍑

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681109546353097?s=46

Metro Atlanta finished strong, with large counties recording ~80,000 votes in just the final two hours (5-7 PM) yesterday.

Polls closed in rural counties at 5 pm, so Democratic counties drove that final surge.

This surge could preview Election Day potential.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681112780423197?s=46

Current early voting totals in key counties:

Fulton: 57.9%

DeKalb: 58.1%

Gwinnett: 54.6%

Cobb: 60.2%

Clayton: 46.3%

Chatham: 48.1%

Richmond: 42.8%

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681115032781024?s=46

The story varies significantly by county. Gwinnett, despite its size and importance, has the most ground to cover to match its total 2020 turnout.

At 54.6%, it needs 96.2% of its 2020 Election Day performance to match overall 2020 turnout.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681117633233217?s=46

Other Metro Atlanta counties have built more cushion through early voting.

DeKalb can match 2020 with 79.6% of its previous Election Day turnout.

Cobb, thanks to strong early voting at 60.2%, needs just 75.8%.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681120045027676?s=46

Fulton, Clayton, and Chatham all need about 67% of their 2020 Election Day numbers - significant cushion built through early voting success.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681140727169382?s=46

A key indicator for Harris:

Women's turnout has already exceeded 2020 levels, reaching 56% versus 55.3% in the last cycle.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681357752668251?s=46

The 2020 to 2024 comparison reveals a crucial shift: Metro Atlanta voted heavily by mail in 2020 due to COVID.

This year, a large pool of traditional Election Day voters remains available.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681444654735746?s=46

Meanwhile, rural northeast Georgia—Republican strongholds—has nearly exhausted its voter pool, with few Election Day voters left.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681538087035022?s=46

Metro Atlanta as well as other blue counties all retain substantial untapped potential voters.

Those final two hours of early voting demonstrated the capacity for high turnout in these population centers.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681756518096930?s=46

This sets up a fascinating Election Day dynamic:

Metro Atlanta and other blue counties have both more work to do AND more voters available to do it.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852681878492569669?s=46

The pressure point is Gwinnett, where matching 2020 numbers will require the strongest Election Day performance relative to last cycle.

If you have some time between now and Election Day, please volunteer to canvass and help GOTV.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852682170193875302?s=46

Let's return to the Harris victory metrics:

I’m not seeing any signs of Democratic demoralization in Metro Atlanta's strong early voting numbers, while Trump faces headwinds in maxed-out rural areas.

https://xcancel.com/dataandpolitics/status/1852682392391303673?s=46

These aren't predictions - they're patterns.

But the checklist of what Harris would need for victory in Georgia has been steadily filled during early voting.

There will be a lot of scrutiny of the polls after we know the results to see which pollsters were right and which pollsters were way off. We’ve written about this too!

However, if these are NEW voters who were not going to vote on election day anyway, then that’s great news for Republicans. 

On the flip side, there seems to be evidence that women are voting in greater numbers than men. If that trend continues and is sustained, that could be a strong sign for Harris.

Re the Senate and House races, voters often feel a personal connection to these candidates. So it's not uncommon for a House or Senate candidate to perform five or more points differently than the presidential candidate. Sen. Tester in Montana will likely need a sizable gap in his performance from Harris's numbers in order to keep his seat. Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio is another one who will need to do much better than Harris in order to hang on.",2024-10-30 17:09:55,0,politics,True,1

Leaving aside the fact that Trump's mob came within a couple of wrong turns down the corridor of... if not overthrowing democracy then at least plunging it into complete crisis, this rebuttal you present is actually a massive self-contradiction. Trump has spent the last 8 years since his election complaining about how it's terrible that the deep state was impeding his agenda; the ""deep state"" of course being all the public servants, medical experts, generals, etc. who restrained his worst impulses or persuaded him not to take blatantly illegal actions. 

But this time around his platform (plus promises from his running mate, advisors, likely cabinet appointments, etc.) is aimed at removing those impediments - sacking vast swathes of the public service and replacing them with loyalists who won't restrict his behaviour. Passing over ""establishment"" cabinet picks in favour of pliable goons. And so on.

So Trump is simultaneously arguing that ""it'll be fine because last time I wasn't a dictator (due to the deep state stopping me)"" and also ""this time I'll be unrestricted by the deep state because I'm going to fire them all and do what I want"".

Big fan, love watching you on election nights as the returns come in. By far the most informative of all the networks.

My question is how do you explain the disconnect we are seeing between the top-line numbers of state/national polls that points to a virtually tied race everywhere and all the other data that is pointing to at least an environment as good as 2020 for Democrats, if not a bit better?

By the other data, I'm referring to Senate polls, district-level polls, county-level polls, demographic polls, the Washington primary, etc. All these things were warning signs in 2016 despite the top-lines of polls showing a comfortable win for Clinton. Likewise, in 2020, the Washington primary predicted a much closer race than the polls were showing.

Do you think pollsters this cycle are herding? Or do you think that methodological changes they made, like many weighting to 2020 recalled vote, is going to lead to overestimating Trump in these polls? Or do you believe all that other data is wrong?",2024-10-28 17:00:21,80,politics,True,1

lu7d0dc,"Good afternoon Steve! 

  
First.  You're my favorite person to watch EVERY single election cycle.  Thanks for all the hard work you do.

  
I do not believe the polls AT all.  For a couple of reasons.

1. GOP influence to influence voter turnout (for Republicans - against Democrats).  Got it.  

2. Pollsters past history and worriment over future legitimacy.  The last poll that was correct was in 2008.  We are SO far off from that and they are all very worried about being legitimized for future polls.  I feel as if they're past performance in 2016 and 2020 was so far off that they are over analyzing and over correcting for the PRESIDENT race only.  If we look at down-ballot races we see wildy different (yet consistent) numbers but they don't match the presidential swings we are seeing.  Example: Gallego and Lake in AZ.  He is consistently ahead 6-8 points but Trump went from down 2 to now up 6?  

3. Democrats ALSO want close polls to drive voter turnout and to continue to raise the GAJILLIONS of dollars they are collecting to help defeat Cheeto Mussolini and his merry band of shadow-Nazi's.

  
My question:  Polls and actual results.

Are the results you are seeing so far correlating better with the presidential polls or ACTUALLY with down ballot polls like the Senate races and Representative races?  

  
Sorry for the long question.  Thank you for your time!",2024-10-28 17:00:21,47,politics,True,1
lu7ezik,"Hi Steve, thanks for taking the time today.

While millions of Americans will cast their votes in the US election, a tiny fraction of those will swing the race for one candidate or another and the voters in certain areas represent uniquely important demographics.

I feel it could be enlightening to examine specific areas in swing states which Biden managed to flip in 2020. 

For example…

* Erie County, Pennsylvania (2016 Trump +2, 2020 Biden +1)
* Kent County, Michigan (2016 Trump +3, 2020 Biden +6.1)
* Maricopa County, Arizona (2016 Trump +3, 2020 Biden +2.2),

What are you currently seeing out of places like Western Pennsylvania, the Grand Rapids area of Michigan, and Maricopa County in Arizona?

That’s giving me hope that Harris’ biggest strength (Democratic-leaning female voters) are very highly motivated and mobilizing.

With that being said, based on demographics, the gender split and even how much support Biden had in 2020, the votes as of yesterday suggest she was down around ~0.9% (assuming things like third party support and splits hold at 2020 levels - they won’t of course, but that’s all I could reasonably use). There are still a lot of votes in the Atlanta metro to get though, so this thing is going to be close!

They're totally fine and okay with a dictatorship as long as the dictator is doing things they agree with. (And again, these people don't actually think they want a ""dictator.""

That said, I am not sanguine about these things. We can see in countries like Iran how a minority of fanatics can take over the government and remake a nation in their image. So we should be worried.

The Big Lie, which you cite, may be the cleanest version of this. It is objectively true that Biden got more votes and more electoral college votes than Trump. But it doesn't \*feel\* true to them, because those votes largely came from people they've come to believe do not deserve to be considered real Americans: People of color, white liberals, LGBTQ people, childless cat ladies, etc. 

You know how you can read or watch a work of fiction and know it's not true but it speaks to a deeper truth? I think there's emotional DNA between that and what MAGA does with ""alternative facts"" and conspiracy theories. Except the big difference is, with fiction, there's an infrastructure and context that allows us to draw a bright red line between pretend and reality. Or when you're playing an RGP. There's walls that allow the ""alternative"" truth to stay where it is, and reality to stay where it is. But what the right does is deliberately blur that distinction, so what feels true to them gets conflated with facts. 

Trump didn't invent this. He was pushing on an open door. The religious right for years has cultivated this mindset of unreality. The Satanic panic was a good example from the past.

lvgdisa,">Do you think polls overestimate trump voters who don’t respond to polls , and Harris could be leading a larger percentage?

Not likely. 

The reason that I say this is that Rasmussen and a few others are very clear about their methodology. They aren't overestimating any ""hidden"" (or ""guessed"") Trump voters. That would really destroy the credibility of a poll. 

Rather, Rasmussen is simply making a traditional ""likely voter"" based upon previous turnout. Within that, they do account for some voter enthusiasm indicators. This is where polls like NY Times-Siena are flawed (in my opinion). 

Since Joe Biden dropped out of the election, this small subset of pollsters perceive a higher enthusiasm for Kamala Harris than I believe is accurate. They base this on favorability and a gap between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. 

On average, Kamala Harris has a 4.1% better favorability compared with President Trump. However, there are some outlier polls -- and they tend to be the same polls that are favoring Kamala Harris. 

Marist, NY Times-Siena and a few others even give her a positive rating (meaning more people like her than dislike her). However, most other polls show her favorability index quite negative -- with some having it at or under President Trump's negatives. 

The problem, of course, is that this is a NATIONAL index rather than a state index. The only favorability that matters is within each of the battleground states. In those, I suspect President Trump polls higher than  nationally. The question is whether Kamala Harris would poll more negative or even with President Trump. Both (negative and even) would bode poorly for her in terms of potential enthusiasm. 

Personally, I think that the Hill and Atlas polls are more likely. The only possible exception is with Michigan and (potentially) Nevada. President Trump would still win with Pennsylvania (and/or Wisconsin). Moreover, if Trump overperforms the polls half as well as he did in 2020 in the battleground states, then I think that he will win all of the battleground states.",2024-11-04 23:32:06,3,Conservative,True,1

He is too liberal for Texas"" or my favorite ""He wants to have drag shows on military bases. Colin Allred is for they/them, Cruz is for you.""

""Ted Cruz is a piece of shit. 

He left Texas in the middle of a natural disaster, with people dying, so he could hang out in Cancun. The only reason he came back was because he got caught trying to sneak out on video. Cruz did nothing to help Texans in a time of crisis. 

Our children are being mowed down in schools and Cruz is nowhere to be found except in the NRA's pocket book. Cruz has done nothing. 

Our education system in Texas is failing, and Cruz has done nothing.  

Trump called his wife ugly and now he licks Trump's boots and Cruz did nothing. 

No Texan, no matter who you vote for, is going to be okay with you calling his wife ugly. 

Cruz has done nothing to help Texans at any time while in the Senate.

Registered Republicans have cast about 2% more votes than Dems- which would appear to be a narrow lead.

Even if just one in ten of those anti-Trump (but still Republican) voters decides to vote Harris, that still means over 5% of total Republican votes or so will actually be votes for Harris.

ltimuqy,"Biden is senile. That is why we replaced him with Kamala. Trump is a traitor, criminal, fraud, rapist, (and probably a pedophile, the evidence leans heavily in that direction) and a greedy corporate pig who wants to deregulate industry so it can pillage the Earth for short-term profits. Kamala, despite her dismal performance in 2020, has matured into an excellent candidate. But she has a hearty, healthy, charming laugh, and that is very off-putting for some people like Trump who has never laughed in his life. Also she is dealing with world-wide inflation and economic upheaval, so, despite having an economy that is the envy of the world, and the best job market in the history of America, ripples of the world's economy still effect the USA a little bit. I understand undecided voters though, the smiley woman, or the fascist traitor rapist guy, its a tough choice. Both sides are basically the same.",2024-10-23 19:35:21,-4,PoliticalDiscussion,True,0

lrmmmvl,"That’s taking a macro problem and evaluating it with a unidimensional lens especially with a sample size of 1 and doubly so when that sample size of 1 is the 2020 election which took place amidst a pandemic. 

I’m not saying you’re wrong, just that you’re reading a bit too much into a single data point and also comparing polling of one event with the actual outcomes of the other. It would be better to first start with 2020 polling of likelihood mail in ballot voters and compare it with actuality to see if there is some sort of polling bias. 

Still though I think there are too many variables not accounted for that would need to be investigated first before jumping to conclusion that this is a proxy for enthusiasm. 

Also the infrastructure for voting by mail has come A LONG way since 2020 and in different ways; in a lot of liberal areas voting by mail has become so seamless that seeing a jump in this stat is expected whereas same gains may not have been made in more rural GOP strongholds.",2024-10-12 08:41:22,22,PoliticalDiscussion,True,0

>A surprising number of respondents don’t remember how they voted; they seem likelier to remember voting for the winner; and they sometimes report voting when voting records show they did not.

Has this behavior changed much before and after Trump?

As someone who's worked as a data analyst before this makes sense.  People are notoriously bad with self reporting even simple things everybody should know about themselves.  Whether it be their age, the city they were born in, consistently self-identifying their ethnicity, etc.  You can poll the same group three times with the same set of questions and get three different sets of answers that do not reconcile.  

But as somebody who is into politics and interacts with a lot of people 
in regards to politics at (various enthusiasm levels), it's hard for me to grasp.  Especially these days when the division is so high and people firmly place themselves into echo chambers that constantly reaffirm their views.  

But people have all sorts of weird psychological hangups.  Instead of misremembering I think it's likely a lot of them are deliberately lying, because perhaps they felt remorse, for whatever reason.",2024-10-11 12:46:32,28,PoliticalDiscussion,True,1

lrru0q1,"I think there is an alterantive explanation, other than ""Trump just brings some kind of electoral magic sauce whenever he's on the ballot"": turnout has always been a lot higher in presidential than in non-presidential years. High-propensity voters which disproportionately show up in midterms and special elections skew heavily toward the educated and wealthy. Pre-Trump, this tended to benefit the GOP, but the trump-era saw both parties switch white college for white non-college voters. 

Upscale, highly educated white suburbs nowadays lean decidedly to Democrats, and those are the places which make up an outsized share of midterm electorates.  Conversely, a lot of the low propensity black or hispanic men lean a lot more toward the GOP these days than they did in the era of Obama and Romney.",2024-10-11 12:46:32,2,PoliticalDiscussion,True,0
lrq7pw2,"I believe the Covid factor will be less consequential than the effects of January 6th and Dobbs, but I will also contend that we have to get through this election cycle before it can be contended it has had no effect. Low propensity voters who don’t show up in midterms—aka Trump voters—we won’t know if they’re dead until a presidential election that features Trump. I think this has a direct effect on Trump enthusiasm for the polls. The biggest MAGA die hards are some of the folks I personally know who died from the disease. If Trump has lost his basiest base, what then?

Dobbs came down in June 2022, and most states didn’t pass laws restricting abortion until after the election. I have not heard about weighting for this issue despite massive turnout in office elections that feature abortion on the ballot. Abortion is on the ballot in 10 states, half of those are swing states, and I have hardly heard a peep about it from pollsters. 

I think the repressed GOP turnout in 2022 is a direct result of actual patriotic conservatives not showing up because of J6. The height of inflation was June 2022 at 9.1%, and the GOP only won a six seat majority that year. Unreal. Now that Trump has been indicted, this measure is completely ignored when using 2020 recall data, as most of the polls have done. 

The pollsters aren’t accounting for any of it. I live in a toss up county in an otherwise red state. Trump enthusiasm is through the floor here. Hardly any signs, bumper stickers,
